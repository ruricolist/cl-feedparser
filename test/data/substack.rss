I thought it interesting, and no doubt useful, and then forgot about it for years and years.</p><p>Until yesterday in fact, when I first read the submission that follows. It&#8217;s funny how life works, you can forget something, you can neglect it, you can ignore it even but if you are meant to take it in it will somehow boomerang its way back to you in some fashion.</p><p>Anyway, in this practical and deceptively simple piece Cameron (in his debut STSC submission) reminds us just how fallible memory can be and just how much so many of us have allowed our powers of retention and recall to atrophy in this screen based age. Something to consider.

I believe it was one of his <em>Sandman</em> graphic novels. And in the afterword (I think it was the afterword) were a few lines about fantasy author Gene Wolfe and a writing exercise he&#8217;d learned from him.</p><p>The idea behind the exercise is simple: take a short story, or perhaps a chapter from a book, and study it&#8212;I mean really study it. Line by line, word for word: etch each letter into your mind so you can sit down at your desk and rewrite the entire text verbatim.</p><p>Right, so&#8230;the idea behind the exercise is simple enough; the execution is something else.</p><p>Here&#8217;s the thing: there&#8217;s no way in hell anyone (least of all, me) is going to completely memorize a short story&#8212;even a very short story&#8212;without dedicating a considerable amount of time and effort.</p><p>But that&#8217;s okay; the point of this exercise is to compare the original text with what you&#8217;re able to conjure from memory. This way you can observe the little nooks and crannies in your replication and see for yourself what&#8217;s missing to make the story whole. There&#8217;s even a chance you may accidentally improve the original text in some unforeseen way.</p><p>And now for a little disclaimer: I&#8217;ve never attempted this exercise before, so I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I&#8217;m getting myself into, but because of personal time constraints, as well as your patience as a reader, I&#8217;m going to select a very short story to experiment with.</p><p>In fact, that&#8217;s also the title of the story: &#8220;A Very Short Story&#8221; by Ernest Hemingway, which you can find in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Short-Stories-Ernest-Hemingway/dp/0684843323">The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</a></em>.</p><p>I&#8217;m not sure how well this is going to turn about but hopefully we can all learn something from the attempt.</p><p>Alrighty, first things first&#8212;here is the original text of &#8220;A Very Short Story&#8221; as published in my edition of <em>The Complete Short Stories</em>. Enjoy.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>A Very Short Story</strong> by Ernest Hemingway</p><p>One hot evening in Padua they carried him up onto the roof and he could look out over the top of the town. There were chimney swifts in the sky. After a while it got dark and the searchlights came out. The others went down and took the bottles with them. He and Luz could hear them below on the balcony. Luz sat on the bed. She was cool and fresh in the hot night.</p><p>Luz stayed on night duty for three months. They were glad to let her. When they operated on him she prepared him for the operating table; and they had a joke about friend or enema. He went under the an&#230;sthetic holding tight on to himself so he would not blab about anything during the silly, talky time. After he got on crutches he used to take the temperatures so Luz would not have to get up from the bed. There were only a few patients, and they all knew about it. They all liked Luz. As he walked back along the halls he thought of Luz in his bed.</p><p>Before he went back to the front they went into the Duomo and prayed. It was dim and quiet, and there were other people praying. They wanted to get married, but there was not enough time for the banns, and neither of them had birth certificates. They felt as though they were married, but they wanted every one to know about it, and to make it so they could not lose it.</p><p>Luz wrote him many letters that he never got until after the armistice. Fifteen came in a bunch to the front and he sorted them by the dates and read them all straight through. They were all about the hospital, and how much she loved him and how it was impossible to get along without him and how terrible it was missing him at night.</p><p>After the armistice they agreed he should go home to get a job so they might be married. Luz would not come home until he had a good job and could come to New York to meet her. It was understood he would not drink, and he did not want to see his friends or any one in the States. Only to get a job and be married. On the train from Padua to Milan they quarreled about her not being willing to come home at once. When they had to say good-bye, in the station at Milan, they kissed good-bye, but were not finished with the quarrel. He felt sick about saying good-bye like that.</p><p>He went to America on a boat from Genoa. Luz went back to Pordenone to open a hospital. It was lonely and rainy there, and there was a battalion of <em>arditi</em> quartered in the town. Living in the muddy, rainy town in the winter, the major of the battalion made love to Luz, and she had never known Italians before, and finally wrote to the States that theirs had been only a boy and girl affair. She was sorry, and she knew he would probably not be able to understand, but might some day forgive her, and be grateful to her, and she expected, absolutely unexpectedly, to be married in the spring. She loved him as always, but she realized now it was only a boy and girl love. She hoped he would have a great career, and believed in him absolutely. She knew it was for the best.</p><p>The major did not marry her in the spring, or any other time. Luz never got an answer to the letter to Chicago about it. A short time after he contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl in a loop department store while riding in a taxicab through Lincoln Park.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Before I inflict my rewritten version of the story on you, here are a few notes on my effort to memorize the text:</p><ul><li><p>I spent about an hour rereading the story over and over again.</p></li><li><p>I then copied the story from my Kindle onto the post you&#8217;re reading right now.</p></li><li><p>And that&#8217;s it.</p></li></ul><p>Granted, the story I chose to work with is pretty short, but it quickly became evident that my short-term memory is borderline nonexistant and unless I put a few more hours in there&#8217;s no way I could&#8217;ve gotten it perfect.</p><p>Anyway, here&#8217;s my rendition of &#8220;A Very Short Story&#8221;. Brace yourself.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>A Very Short Story </strong>by Ernest Hemingway and Cameron Bradley</p><p>One hot evening in Padua they carried him onto the roof and he could look out over the top of the town.

I felt fairly confident I was hammering out the text word-for-word for the first two paragraphs; by paragraph #5 (out of 7) I realized I could no longer remember the exact sentences; I could only recall the basic events of the story&#8230;the exact language was lost to me.</p><p>Overall, I think Papa Hemingway would be proud, but I&#8217;m annoyed that I couldn&#8217;t nail the last paragraph, which is the punchline of this tragicomic gem and one of my favorite endings to any short story I&#8217;ve ever read.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of my mistakes by paragraph:</p><p><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sentence #1: I forgot the word &#8220;up&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #3: I wrote &#8220;on&#8221; instead of &#8220;out&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #5: I wrote &#8220;talking on the balcony below&#8221; rather than &#8220;below on the balcony&#8221;.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sentence #1: I wrote &#8220;worked night duty&#8221; rather than &#8220;stayed on night duty&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #4: I wrote &#8220;When he went under the an&#230;sthetic he held tight&#8230;&#8221; rather than &#8220;He went under the an&#230;sthetic holding tight on to himself&#8230;&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #5: I wrote &#8220;After he was on crutches, he used to take the temperature of the other patients&#8230;&#8221; rather than &#8220;After he got on crutches he used to take the temperatures&#8230;&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #6: I omitted a comma between &#8220;patients&#8221; and &#8220;and&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #8: I wrote &#8220;As he walked back along the hallway he would think about&#8230;&#8221; rather than &#8220;As he walked back along the halls he thought of&#8230;&#8221;.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sentence #3: I omitted the second clause of the sentence, after &#8220;banns&#8221;: (&#8220;and neither of them had birth certificates.&#8221;).</p></li><li><p>Sentence #4: I wrote &#8220;They felt as if they were already married, but they wanted everyone&#8230;&#8221; rather than &#8220;They felt as though they were married, but they wanted every one&#8230;&#8221;.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sentence #1: I wrote &#8220;which he did not recieve&#8221; instead of &#8220;that he never got&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #2: I wrote &#8220;of them arrived in a bunch&#8221; instead of &#8220;came in a bunch&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #3: I wrote &#8220;&#8230;she could not get along without him and how terribly she missed him at night&#8221; rather than &#8220;&#8230;it was impossible to get along without him and how terrible it was missing him at night&#8221;.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Paragraphs 5 and 6:</strong></p><ul><li><p>There are too many minor discrepencies to list without giving everybody, including myself, a major headache.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Paragraph 7:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sentence #2: I wrote &#8220;recieved a response&#8221; rather than &#8220;got an answer&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Sentence #3: I wrote &#8220;later&#8221; instead of &#8220;after&#8221;.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p><p>My personal take on this exercise is that choosing a story that&#8217;s too short doesn&#8217;t challenge the writer to bridge forgotton gaps in a larger plot. None of the differences between my rendition of Hemingway&#8217;s story and the original were so great as to reveal major flaws or inspire better ways of telling the tale; rather, I merely aimed to be a perfectionist and managed to mess up minor details several times over.</p><p>That&#8217;s not too say I didn&#8217;t learn anything from this; constantly rereading and striving to commit the words to memory fostered insight into the workings of the piece as a whole. And as Hemingway fan, I marveled at the way so few details seemed to unfold into a cohesive story with&#8212;for Hemingway&#8212;an unusually humorous ending.</p><p>What did you think?

Something that would stroke our egos daily if we weren&#8217;t six feet under.</p><p>But is legacy something we should be proactively working towards, or just an after-affect of how we live our lives?</p></blockquote><p>Great essay from Phil here- personal, nuanced to the point of going against the grain of a lot of contemporary received wisdom about legacy (especially from the business/self improvement spheres) and heartfelt. This is the real deal.</p><h3><a href="https://acabinetofcuriosities.substack.com/p/on-death?r=bu9kr&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">On Death by Minna</a></h3><p>Minna asked if she could submit an older piece from her archive to this Symposium. Normally I&#8217;m against this practice but I gave it a read out of politeness and once I read it I simply could not refuse.</p><h3><a href="https://clintavo.substack.com/p/the-dance-of-light-and-dark">The Dance of Light and Dark by Clint</a></h3><p>Short but powerful with each of the many two, three or four word sentences acting as sharp jabs to try and wake you up and get you to think and feel. I had high hopes for Clint on this one and he absolutely delivers.</p><h3><a href="https://journal.coffee/the-unfortunate-death-of-a-world-inspired/">the unfortunate death of a world inspired by Deepansh</a></h3><p>Fascinating to see the usually equanimous, playful Deepansh explore genuine pessimism in his writing. Shows the extent of his range, and that there can be no understanding of the light without also surveying the dark.</p><h3><a href="https://www.lyle.blog/p/how-to-prepare-medications-andor">How to Prepare Medications, and/or Thoughts on Life and Death by Lyle McKeany</a></h3><p>This took me back to my own previous line of work where I had to draw up medication (I am extremely fast at the 14 times table because each blister pack of has 14 pills within it and when you have to check the counts of dozens of different medications this skill can save you a lot of time over the course of a shift). A truly wonderful piece as always and the lesson about specificity in writing is one that is absolutely worth its weight in gold.</p><h3><a href="https://lenright.substack.com/p/elden-ring-the-omen-king-and-the?sd=pf">Elden Ring, the Omen King, and the Shadow of Death by Lyle Enright</a></h3><p>I know nothing about Elden Ring and haven&#8217;t played computer games for decades. So the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this story speaks to its quality. And yes, Lyle, I do forgive you for selfishly keeping you death fiction for yourself!</p><h3><a href="https://fbfanat.substack.com/p/a-good-death?sd=pf">A Good Death by F.B. Fanat</a></h3><p>The beauty of the Symposium is that it can coax our members who do not see themselves as writers especially to get involved. F.B. is a fine example of this and I&#8217;m proud to have him on the roster. This is a very, very good essay indeed.</p><h3><a href="https://terryfreedman.substack.com/p/the-death-of-writers-block">The death of writer's block by Terry</a></h3><p>I&#8217;m surprised only Terry chose to exploit the to my mind obvious &#8216;death of&#8217; loophole here. Talk about &#8216;the death of X&#8217; and you are still on topic for the subject of death while simultaneously being able to discuss whatever you want. He&#8217;s a wily fox that Terry, and a highly skilled writer too it turns out.</p><h3><a href="https://samanthachildress.substack.com/p/the-arbitrariness-of-borders">The Arbitrariness of Borders by Samantha</a></h3><blockquote><p>Stories bring order to the chaos and randomness of human experience; they extract sense from nonsense. But what happens when our old stories no longer serve us?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Man, I could pull so many great quotes, one-liners and insights from this one. An absolute banger, up there with the very best of Samantha&#8217;s work which is saying something.</p><h3><a href="https://vitabenes.substack.com/p/sir-terry-pratchetts-death">Sir Terry Pratchett's Death by Vita</a></h3><p>I believe it was one of Sir Terry&#8217;s <em>Discworld</em> books that was the first non-children&#8217;s book that I ever read. So I felt this. </p><p>I suspect you will too.</p><h3><a href="https://edwardrooster.substack.com/p/the-great-herenow">The Great Herenow by Edward</a></h3><p>Just under the wire from Edward. But more than worth it. This truly gets to the heart of the matter and explains the drive that makes the man such a prolific and fascinating writer. This piece is as real as it gets.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Fiction</h2><h3><a href="https://acabinetofcuriosities.substack.com/p/i-am-ichabod?sd=pf">I am Ichabod by Minna (again)</a></h3><p>Something old (see above) and something new. I loved the voice of this one- our modern ancient narrator throwing out his casual thoughts and observations. This was someone who I thoroughly enjoyed spending some time with. </p><h3><a href="https://adam-kozak.com/2023/04/14/growing-and-dying/">Growing and Dying by Adam Kozak</a></h3><p>I think one of the highest and truest compliments you can pay a story or an essay is to say &#8216;I wish I&#8217;d&#8217;ve written this.&#8217; </p><p>Well, I wish I&#8217;d&#8217;ve written this.</p><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRJZc1XWNsA7-0opnIq_TB3hCWfEHXoZAbGXVg_DqO0CP7uPxlxLWvTjoO3JZ6jnFyjihmMfiaD9hcf/pub">A Slow Death by Jeanne</a></h3><p>Jeanne has the exact type of humour I look for, just the right mixture of dark, silly and absurd. I loved this one.</p><h2><a href="https://www.nova-nevedoma.com/daas/">DaaS by Vanya</a></h2><p>There&#8217;s just no one else like Vanya writing today. A unique voice among unique voices, a writer writer&#8230;</p><h3><a href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/soon">Soon by Vanya (again)</a></h3><p>&#8230; which is why I have both allowed him to be featured twice and feature a piece here that has already been showcased on the main STSC Substack page. When you are talented enough you can get away with murder it seems.</p><h3><a href="https://dcreed.substack.com/p/none-of-this-makes-sense">None of This Makes Sense by Victor</a></h3><p>Fantastic. I reckon this might be Victors best story to date. Read it immediately.</p><h3><a href="https://trilety.substack.com/p/please-suggest-a-title-for-me">Velvet is the Excised Skin of Night by Trilety</a></h3><p>The fact the url for this piece reads /please-suggest-a-title-for-me made me chuckle. I think every writer has been there- &#8216;I have this idea, this thing, but I&#8217;m not exactly sure what it is and I have no idea what to call it.&#8217;</p><p>I guess maybe this happens with Trilety with some regularity given how unusual, unique and without precedent here work and her style is. But would you really want it any other way.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Poetry </h2><h3><a href="https://yardenaschwersky.substack.com/p/if-we-meet-in-the-cemetery?utm_source=%2Finbox&amp;utm_medium=reader2">If We Meet in the Cemetery by Yardena</a></h3><p>Yardena campaigned for the topic of Death <em>hard </em>over at the STSC community. Now I see why, and given the quality of this and all of the other submissions on display I&#8217;m glad she did.</p><h2><a href="https://jamesmaynard.substack.com/p/bury-me-in-a-shanty-of-notes-that">Bury me in a shanty of notes that follow me down. by James Maynard</a></h2><p>This sonnet may be reproduced in full as an image below but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can get away with not clicking the link above and subscribing to James or at least giving him a like and a comment.

He could barely stand as it were.&nbsp; His hands grasped the dirt next to his body as he tried to pull himself off the cold, hard earth, but his legs were still numb. The soldier&#8217;s mouth flew open with the remains of his last meal launched from his stomach as he rolled to his left, face planting into thick mud.</p><p>He wiped his eyes, squinted, and saw them: His band. Lifeless. Cold. Soon becoming one with the remnants of the battlefield.</p><p>The naked sky above him was harassed by circling predators preparing their descent to gobble up scraps of flesh that belonged to the men he once called his brothers.</p><p>It was morning. Though the land was darkened with the smoke of the burning camp and rotting carcasses, Raynal knew it was morning. But the sun would not rise today.&nbsp;</p><p>He lost his sword, helmet, or shield. When he slipped his tongue around&nbsp; his mouth, he found several holes where teeth used to be. All he could taste was blood. Finally, he stood up and steadied himself, placing his hand over his eyes hoping to see better of the land known as Magia &#8211; Warlock country.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;All magic is dark magic,&#8221; the Captain&#8217;s grim voice plagued Raynal&#8217;s ears. &#8220;Take a detachment of cavalry and scout the roads leading to Castle Auld. Await further instructions.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>They waited. Then waited. After a night of feasting and drinking, their heads fell silently upon their mats into deep sleep until finally, the Great Deceivers came and scorched the camp with rolling monsters forged in iron, spitting flame and great flying beats dropping explosives and gas from the heavens. Their band was easy prey. Now hours after the assault, Raynal was all that was left.&nbsp;</p><p>Light rain began to fall as did any of his hopes to be reunited with his own countrymen. Death&#8217;s hand was tightening around his neck and he made every attempt imaginable to find a short sword nearby to fall on. Raynal had studied the scriptures: To be a lone survivor of such an onslaught would be offensive to the Gods. If the enemy was gone and he had no one to fight, then his life must be forfeited. This was the law of the Gods.</p><p>The Deceivers made magic and industry their gods. Factory smog poured into the air from the great Magia mountains while the old fools flirted with hellions and their black sorcery to secure their positions as the most powerful beings. They had no respect for religion or the old ways. Raynal&#8217;s King would rather see these dark practitioners put to the sword than make peace with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Soft groans of agony rang from afar. His hearing was not the best, but he knew the cry of a fallen comrade immediately and hobbled his way through piles of severed limbs and decaying horses in a humble attempt to help a fallen man.&nbsp;</p><p>A young soldier, his legs no more, whimpered and muttered his prayers. Raynal kneeled before him and cradled his head in his lap.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Maurice,&#8221; Raynal&#8217;s voice was soft. &#8220;Brother, I am here.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Maurice&#8217;s face was blackened with ash and grime. His left eye was gone. His breathing slow and heavy.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Bastards&#8230;caught us by surprise didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Yes&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Damn daemons&#8230;with their magic.&#8221; Maurice coughed into a fit. Blood dripped from his mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>Raynal looked around him, still searching for a sword or spear.</p><p>&#8220;Remember that night&#8230;.after the Battle of Manns. The wine, the food, the whores&#8230;by the Gods, the whores.&#8221; They both laughed recounting such nights of debauchery. They were raw recruits just three years prior. The King&#8217;s war against Magia would make them family.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;You never partook&#8230;did you Ray? No,&#8221; the coughing continued, &#8220;too busy writing poetry to that girl you saw back home. What was her name?&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Penelope.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Maurice closed his eyes and sighed, &#8220;Penelope. Perhaps one day you&#8217;ll read her your poems, eh?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Perhaps one day.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Remember our first march?&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;I do, brother.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&#8220;Gods, we were still boys then. Playing soldier. I&#8217;d never seen&#8230;my father so&#8230;proud.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Rest, Maurice. No sense talking of the past.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all we have now, Ray. That&#8217;s all&#8230;.we&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The air expelled from Maurice&#8217;s body. Now he was quiet. Raynal covered him with his cape and prayed. As he said goodbye, the ground beneath him began to tremble. Thunder boomed above and hard lightning cracked, shaking the earth. Raynal looked up. He could see the colossal machines in the far distance, with a legion of fierce looking fiends and undead soldiers advancing towards his position. The Warlock&#8217;s army would descend once again.&nbsp;</p><p>Raynal stood for a moment and began to march ahead. He remembered the farm girl Penelope who stole his heart with a smile. He remembered his hard training days with Maurice and the other soldiers of his band. Back then, they spoke of war as their birthright. They read books on the conquests of their forefathers and would sing the ballads of knights slaying giants, each verse memorized. They would play with wooden swords and shields, dreaming one day they would taste hard-fought glory and celebrate in the brothels and feast halls.<br>Now they were men and Rayanal was the last one to stand.&nbsp;</p><p>He found a dagger still clutched in the hands of a dead old friend and held it firm.</p><p>His heart began to race as he watched the unholy horde begin their charge. He regained full feeling in his legs and ran at full speed.&nbsp;Fate was calling his name.</p><p>The Gods would favor Raynal today, he was sure of it. Though death was imminent, he felt no fear.&nbsp;</p><p>Would his country remember his name? Would the King smile at the news of his bravery? Would they record this day in the history books? Would the bard sing a joyous song of this last stand?&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps one day.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

That&#8217;s the point at which computers become so intelligent that they decide to take over the world. These fears have been heightened since the appearance of intelligent-seeming artificial intelligence in the form of ChatGPT and similar programs.</p><p>Having had various conversations with machines, or with people ruled by machines, I am not concerned about super-intelligent technology. In fact, I would welcome it. At least if a machine is intelligent, you can reason with it. You can offer arguments that might persuade it to do this instead of that. You can make it see sense.</p><p>Indeed, a <strong>really</strong> intelligent<strong> </strong>machine would be able to detect<strong> </strong>when someone on a Zoom (or similar) call was speaking on their mobile, shouting at their spouse or saying &#8220;coo-ey&#8221; to their dog while the rest of us are trying to take part in a meeting. As things stand now, the host doesn&#8217;t always have the power to switch someone off, as it were, and even when they do they worry about whether doing so would be impolite.&nbsp; ChatGPT and its cousins and descendants would have no such qualms. It would simply mute the person&#8217;s microphone, permanently if necessary, according to a &#8216;three strikes and you&#8217;re out&#8217; rule. The power to mute would be taken out of the host&#8217;s hands, which would be a very welcome development.</p><p>But stupid machines are unable to think for themselves. You cannot reason with them. With a bit of luck and not a little lateral thinking you might be able to fool them into doing what you want. But reasoning with them? Forget it. Let me give a small example, and then a medium example and then a large example.</p><h2>A small example</h2><p>A few years ago I had the following conversation at a supermarket checkout.</p><p>Checkout lady: These tomatoes don&#8217;t exist.</p><p>Me: But I can see them.</p><p>CL: Yes, but they don&#8217;t exist.</p><p>Me: So are we having a group hallucination?</p><p>CL: No, I mean they don&#8217;t exist on our system.</p><p>Me: Excellent! I can have them for free then.</p><p>CL: No. I can&#8217;t let you have them at all. The system won&#8217;t let me.</p><h2>A medium example</h2><p>Last year I was the grateful recipient of credit from a college. But when I tried to book another course, the unfortunate person on the other end of the phone told me that the computer system would not allow her to apply the discount. It said, in effect, &#8220;You&#8217;re having a laugh, mate.&#8221;</p><p>She escalated the issue (I believe I am using the correct terminology) to her line manager. She couldn&#8217;t get the computer to see sense either.&nbsp;</p><p>Who would the problem go to next, I wondered? The Prime Minister?</p><p>But then, in a stroke of genius, the line manager &#8216;told&#8217; the computer that the cost of the course was the actual cost minus my discount. In other words, she lowered the price of the course, and fooled the computer into thinking that I was paying 100% of the price.&nbsp;</p><h2>A large example</h2><p>That was frustrating, but not debilitating. What <strong>was</strong> wearing was the relentless machine that was put into motion when our landline and internet provider decided that we had cancelled our contract. Why? Because they had sent us two handsets and we said, well within the time allowed for requesting a refund, that we didn&#8217;t want them.&nbsp;</p><p>I contacted the company to ask for a refund.</p><p>They said no problem.</p><p>I then received a text message telling me my complaint had been resolved.</p><p>What complaint? I hadn&#8217;t made a complaint. It transpired that this company refers to each and every customer query as a complaint.</p><p>I contacted the company and they said they would definitely cancel the purchase and refund our money.</p><p>I received an email confirming that I had prematurely cancelled our contract, and that our landline would be cut off, along with our broadband. In the meantime, phone calls would cost something like &#163;1 a minute. Mobile calls would cost more. I estimated that we&#8217;d be bankrupt within a few months, assuming we didn&#8217;t die from stress in the meantime.</p><p>Each time I phoned the company, the person I spoke to reached a point where they could do no more.&nbsp;</p><p>The system wouldn&#8217;t let them.</p><p>Eventually (and I&#8217;m cutting a very, very long story short here), we got through to someone who had some seniority over the computer system.</p><p><em>He managed to get us a landline back, though not our own number at first.</em></p><p>I received an email stating that I was going to be charged &#163;600 for cancelling the contract I hadn&#8217;t cancelled.</p><p><em>He managed to get us our old number back.</em></p><p>I received an email stating that I had to return all the internet and phone equipment associated with our internet and landline.</p><p>I received a package containing replicas of the equipment I had been told to return.</p><p><em>He managed to cancel the demands for a fine. He managed to fool the system into thinking I had returned the equipment I didn&#8217;t need to return because it was the same as the equipment they had sent to replace it.</em></p><p>I told him that even after a nuclear Armageddon, this computer system would still be churning out threatening emails and text messages and cutting people off for no reason. Even <strong>he</strong> couldn&#8217;t override everything.</p><h2>Concluding remarks</h2><p>In an astonishing display of prescience, Gordon R. Dickson wrote a short story called Computers Don&#8217;t Argue &#8212; in 1965. What is significant about that date is that the story&#8217;s devastating and terrible ending is caused by an out-of-office reply &#8212; which, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/the-secret-history-of-the-out-of-office-message-and-other-fun-facts-about-this-workplace-staple/">according to Microsoft</a>, did not come into being until the late 1980s. (Spoiler alert: the story begins with the protagonist receiving an overdue notice from the library, and ends with him being executed for murder.)</p><p>When all is said and done, wouldn&#8217;t you rather deal with an intelligent machine than a highly sophisticated automated moron?</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

I will be back soon.'</p><p>'When is "soon"?'</p><p>'Sooner than you think.'</p><p>Yet Myra's father still wasn't home. That careless, cherished by adults, and cryptic to the child's ear, "soon" stretched into three hours and twenty-eight minutes, and the sound of the slammed door still haunted every glass item and each window in their cramped apartment where they had spent the past week. Myra and her mother followed all of the instructions her father had given them: they found the darkest and thickest sheets they could in the wardrobe, covered all the windows in multiple layers, disconnected the telephone's wire from the socket, turned off the lights, lit candles, sat silently, and waited. The latter, as usual, proved to be the hardest of all.</p><p>'The hand goes like this. The knife becomes a part of your arm, so you can steer it safely, and it will never swerve and cut your finger, see? Yes, and put your thumb here. Exactly. Hold tight. Now slice!' said Myra's mother and smiled. 'Good?'</p><p>Myra nodded nervously and began huffing and puffing, transforming the pitiful onion into uneven, ugly slices. Her mother patted her head and in a few steps moved to the other side of the kitchen. The onion pieces, aspiring to become an onion soup, looked so miserable that tears welled in Myra's sore eyes. Yet she kept working with the knife&#8212;slice, slice, slice&#8212;striking it against the cutting board that with all its scuffs reminding her of the stump on which her father chopped wood when they visited the village. Little salty drops fell on the board. Myra immersed herself in the process, hoping to distract herself from ticktocking of the enormous, eerie grandfather clock in the corner. However, she still felt its presence, and the rhythm of the pendulum slicing the air in its wooden womb matched the rhythm of her cutting onions, as if the clock itself were cutting something or someone.</p><p>'Do you know how to play hide'n'seek?'</p><p>'Dad, I'm eight, of course I know how to play hide'n'seek. But I like to play it at home,' Lu muttered.</p><p>'We can't...'</p><p>'Because dangerous people would find us. I know that.'</p><p>'See? You understand how important this is.'</p><p>'Aren't they looking for you?'</p><p>'They're looking for all of us.'</p><p>'All of us.'</p><p>'Yes.'</p><p>'Especially me.'</p><p>'Especially you, and your mum, yes.'</p><p>'Where are you going to go?'</p><p>'To check if we all can go. The news is good.'</p><p>'I don't understand.'</p><p>'You will, I promise.'</p><p>'You promise too much. This way you'll run out of promises soon. And by soon, I mean soon.'</p><p>Were those the same dangerous people who had broken into her father's performance when they were at the theatre, Myra didn't know. Who they were nobody told her either. She overheard that they were policemen but they didn't look like ones to her. Men in knit helmets materialised from nowhere and dragged the actors off stage. She wasn't scared, unlike most of the audience, thinking it was all part of the act. Only when her mother, sitting next to her, leaned over to cover her eyes and whispered something unrecognisable, did she think that maybe it wasn't a play anymore. Then her father with a few people approached them and led them out of the circle through the emergency exit. After that "incident", as her father called it, their life had turned into hide'n'seek of the highest order and she didn't quite like it.</p><p>A brass cuckoo bird peeked from the clock's tower, and the inside bell banged. The knife slipped, scraped the board, and swept the onion pieces onto the floor. Myra froze, listening to the clock's ringing while staring at the candlelight reflections on the knife. Ding-dong. Ding-dong. Ding-</p><p>'Let me pick that up,' Myra's mother said, approaching her. 'Do you want me to finish it?'</p><p>Myra gave no response. Her mother put her hand on Myra's shoulder and leaned in.</p><p>'Go check what the news says. I'll sort this out.'</p><p>Myra sat at the table, pulled selfwards the wee wooden radio with long and thin metal whiskers, put on the headphones, and began switching channels. All she heard was ear-grating white noise. She wondered why someone would broadcast a noise like that, and why not just broadcast silence instead. But every channel responded only with hissing, some with a monotonous beep, and only one of them, on which the news was supposed to run, all of a sudden, with music. It featured a smooth and sultry melody, with a hauntingly beautiful female vocal performance. <em>Eternal embrace, our hearts entwined</em>, the woman sang. <em>In the darkness, our love shines, though death may part us for a while, we'll reunite with a tender smile.</em></p><p>Myra's mother looked at her inquiringly. Myra shook her head in response and continued listening to the song.</p><p><em>And as the shadows start to fall, I hear your voice, your distant call, a whisper carried on the wind, promising our love will never end.</em></p><p>It was somehow comforting despite the words being sad, certainly more comforting than the news would be unless, amidst the white noise, the reporter announced that her father was safe and sound.</p><p>If the rumors were right, the dictator was dead. She had overheard it while her mother and father were habitually whispering in the corridor. What &#8220;the dictator" denoted, Myra didn't definitely know. She thought it might be someone who had good diction, unlike herself, or someone who dictated something and other people had to transcribe it in orderly letters, avoiding any spelling mistakes. Maybe it was a code word for something, or maybe she just misheard it, and it was "director", like her father, the one who told actors what to do, because for some reason, despite being adults, they didn't know what to do. In any case, she didn't understand why the dictator's death would make her parents excited. They weren't like that when her grandpa died, or her grandma a few years before, which she barely remembered. They were sad and even cried a little bit, even when they were not engaged in cutting onions, but she felt nothing. She didn't know what to feel because nobody told her how to act, even her father, who, she thought, was supposed to do that by his profession but consistently failed at it. She pretended that she was also sad but couldn't force herself to cry despite all her attempts of squinting or not blinking. 'When times change and you grow up, you will make a good actress', her father told her. Now, she no longer wanted to become an actress, even if she had ever wanted to, because she didn't want to be dragged off stage by those dangerous people in knit helmets.</p><p>Distracted from cooking, Myra's mother looked at the door. Myra put down the headphones and hushed. Someone, probably one person, was climbing up the stairs, and the footsteps grew louder and louder. It was unlikely to be her dad, Myra thought, because he would be quiet, as he had instructed them. The radio continued playing <em>Eternal Embrace</em>, hissing from the headphones in Myra's hands. Her mother stepped closer to her and turned it off.</p><p>The footsteps stopped when they reached the door. Rustling of clothes. The jingle of keys against the concrete floor. A double knock. Myra's mother approached the door, looked through the peephole, and breathed out. She opened both latches and the chain, and then opened the door.</p><p>There, panting, stood Myra's father in a snow-dusted overcoat. He was smiling and held a large white cardboard box in both hands. He bent down to pick up his keys and stumbled into the apartment.</p><p>Myra jumped from her chair and ran to hug her father.</p><p>'Dead,' he declared. 'It may be over.'</p><p>He ruffled Myra&#8217;s hair and handed her the box. She carried it to the table, opened it, and an alluring aroma wafted into her nostrils. It was a cake, a three-layered honey cake with a creamy filling hinting at orange zest, adorned with intricate golden leaf patterns radiating from the center to the edges like sunbeams, and a sprinkle of berries on top.</p><p>Keeping the black sheets over the windows, they spent the evening together, eating cake and drinking tea, dreaming of the future. Myra's parents laughed and behaved as if the world outside the apartment didn't exist. But Myra couldn't help but feel a pang of confusion, wondering how soon she would learn how to feel happy about someone&#8217;s death.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

He once came home from a night out at 4 a.m. and seeing a bus outside our halls filling up with students from the college next door got chatting with them in his usual amiable way. And that is how he ended up on 120 miles from home with a bus load of sixteen year old Mancunians on a field trip to Whitby fish market. It takes about five hours, there and back, to cross the north of England, around the same amount of time I spent at the end of the year writing his final sociology essay - when he realised that you needed to submit something passable to be allowed to return for another year of drinking - for a nominal fee of a fiver and a case of beer.</p><p>Nowadays though he would have just hit up Chat-GPT.</p><p>AI software can write your college admissions essay, pretty much any undergrad paper, when it does so it submits work in the 90th percentile, and it can even pass the bar exam. Professors decry that students might no longer put the work in and that this would be self-defeating, for the college essay is an opportunity to discover yourself through the writing process, it is the writing that brings out the thoughts, helps you to determine your argument, refine it in the process so you can better understand your own opinion and perspective, so you can understand better who you are and who you want to become. &nbsp;</p><p>They are right, but this is a truism. Because the purpose of anything is to discover yourself through the process of it. That is the point of self-direction. That is what we who work in alternative education settings where children have the autonomy to direct all of their learning already know, and so for us this is a grand opportunity; AI is a mirror to reflect back to the system all its pedagogical flaws.</p><p>That we have established all these complex rituals and tests, numerous hoops to jump through, meticulous grading systems and claims of meritocracy that hold as much water as a teaspoon just obscures us from the fact that if people don't want to do whatever it is they are meant to be engaging in to discover themselves then that is a reflection of us, the adults, and the system we have designed and not them, the children. Self-determination theory teaches us that desires for competency and autonomy are our birthrights and as long as others do not interfere in the process they will remain with us, driving us towards whatever ends we self-select to pursue.&nbsp;</p><p>If we have created an education system where at the pinnacle, after all the chaff has been blown away back to their post-industrial towns, the wheat that remains can't muster the energy to sprout and would rather germinate without having to ruminate then that says a lot about our education system. It says a lot about what we are either asking the young people to do, or the journey we have taken them on to get to the point at which they now look at us and refuse, bored.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's be clear: when children are subject to the flattening and deadening national curriculum, the result is an epistemology where knowledge is <em>done unto, </em>rather than something that you undertake with freedom and creativity. So when they encounter tools such as AI that could be used creatively and they instead choose to avoid passing through the hard work of discovering who they are for the ease of passing the exam they are providing us with clear feedback about how we have encultured them. In education, as in parenting and fiction, the rule is show don't tell.</p><p>Education shows us very clearly that knowledge sits in the realm of doing unto. So when a tool such as a large language model is available to them then young people will do what they have always been shown and do unto just as they were taught.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how a lifetime of schooling ends up with a majority of young people unable to see the point of putting in the work. But they don't have to have a relationship to AI that is predicated upon extractivism, unless they reside in a culture where extractivism is the foundation upon which the culture is built.&nbsp;</p><p>When education is a means for perpetuating socioeconomic status through time, and a way to signal and filter, developments in AI should make educators sit up and take note because here is a potentially revolutionary technology that will even the playing field whilst simultaneously illuminating that it seemingly makes no sense to play.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why AI is not revolutionary to us. Those of us in self-directed education have known that the science on self-direction, autonomy, consent, non-coercive behaviour management systems, and self-determination has been solid for a few decades at least. We have been working in our tiny corner of the field of education safe in the knowledge that a paradigm shift is coming, working with young people in ways that align with the best of what we know of evolutionary anthropology, neuroscience, trauma informed practice, the science of neurodivergence; we are engaging in prefigurative politics: building the new system in the shadows of the old, planting the seeds of the new system in the soil of today&#8217;s.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></p><p>So to us the coming of the moment that the game of mainstream education finally no longer makes any sense to play, when the rest of society starts to see that the way we enculture our children is based not on science but the desires of particular political classes is inevitable.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> So that AI is a midwife to this moment is welcome, but from this weedy patch in the corner of the field we can already see the excessively large farmhouse that is state education shifting in multiple ways as the foundations of sand start to tremor.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></p><p>So obviously in our learning community that means that large language models have a welcome place. It has a place in our Big Ideas Club where we discuss topics together that interest us. So for some of our tweens that means that instead of doing the same Year 7 mathematics that I had to do over twenty years ago their education right now is debating the ethics and existential threats of AI.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></p><p>But it also has a practical place in our goal setting programme.&nbsp;</p><p>I work with a twelve year old who has an interest in anime and wants to learn more about folklore. They are leaning towards Japanese myths because of their current interest in drawing manga characters, but they don&#8217;t really know anything right now, and nor do I.

goals using a combination of planning and reflecting. Though we are aware that lifetime passions can blossom out of interests that come up now, it is not the particular topics that are important, but the meta-cognitive processes and meta-learning skills that we are interested in and that requires there to be a path they are heading towards. We need to break the goal down into manageable steps and stages and have a concrete path to work towards so that we have something to reflect on when we review our progress.&nbsp;</p><p>In some ways we could have utilised Google and got the same end result, but through using the ability to converse in natural language with the model we can take a starting point and burrow our way recursively down into more detail until in only three questions and even fewer minutes we have three titles of books to search for.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></p><p>A few minutes later we see that the last book is massively reduced for kindle and for less than a single pound he can instantly own it and can start reading Japanese folklore. Come next week we will have a chance to reflect on the book and&nbsp;he can iteratively progress through to take another step towards his goal.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></p><div><hr></div><p>I recently asked a twelve year old girl what skills she had, what things she knew and what things she had done.&nbsp;</p><p>I then asked her what skills she wanted to have, what things she wanted to know, and what things she wanted to do.&nbsp;</p><p>One of her interests is cats. I took her through an exercise where she could create a mini-project plan and she came up with creating a cat club she could run for other people in the community. I asked her to write down all the possibilities she could think of for a cat club project, every activity she could put on, every thing she could do or learn and every way she could do or learn them.</p><p>I then filled out a section called suggestions where I made a list of possibilities I thought she hadn&#8217;t considered. We then tried to draw together some of these shared possibilities into a story: how to create a cat club for my friends and peers? From that prompt we built out a task list of three or four weeks worth of activities that she would need to undertake to make that a reality.</p><p>Afterwards we played around with Chat-GPT and we looked at the ways in which large language models can help us create possibilities, how, with skillful prompts, we can give ourselves additional inputs that we can use to pull together into a project proposal. We also looked at how we can ask the software to parse through all the possibilities we have created and notice the themes and how that could help us to unlock project proposals when we are struggling to see which of our thoughts connect to each other. We also saw how we can use Chat-GPT to create a simple gantt chart for our task list.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></p><p>Henrik Karlsson, who writes on how we can scale highly agentic cultures, has written extensively about the apprenticeship model of learning; the amplification of learning under tutoring arrangements, which is an apprentice model of sorts; and how the creation of an exceptional milieu around children provides them with significant advantages. With the internet&#8217;s high connectivity and information capacities we can start to provide that for almost everyone and as a part of that he believes that AI tutors are within reach for every child, but the bottleneck is not the software but culture. I agree, the bottleneck is that ours is a culture that is not highly agentic and the problem is to put it simply school. In<a href="https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/ai-tutors"> AI tutors will be held back by culture</a> Karlsson says this directly:</p><blockquote><p>Making GPT-4 tutor me helps me accelerate my learning, but that is because I&#8217;m obsessed with the questions I study. If introduced in schools, I doubt most children would leverage these systems to grow significantly faster. That is not what they are motivated to do; it is not what their culture motivates them to do.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Karlsson discusses how Khan Academies system built on top of GPT-4 is a way of &#8220;fluidly interacting with information, shaping it through dialogue, [that] is immensely powerful&#8221;, but Khan Academy itself is a powerful tool to help shape and improve learning that when introduced into schools doesn&#8217;t have the effect of improving grades as expected. This is again the same problem; it is not what their culture motivates them to do.&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-rnIgnS8Susg" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;rnIgnS8Susg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rnIgnS8Susg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>But at learning communities where young people are self-directing their education they are surrounded by a culture that motivates them to pursue the questions that obsess them. You may ask, but surely you do not want them to just outsource all their thinking to a large language model? Well, no.&nbsp;</p><p>Iain McGilchrist believes that over the past four centuries Western civilisation has allowed the left hemisphere, predominantly rational and logical thought, to push the right hemisphere, predominantly intuitive, aside. He sees the development of large language models as the culmination of this left hemisphere takeover.&nbsp;</p><p>As well as cat clubs this young twelve year old girl also had a skill they wanted to develop: learning to be brave. This, we decided, was not a skill that should be put to the software to chew over. This was a skill that was tacit, was too individual, too reliant on seizing opportunistic moments for progression that Chat-GPT would never do the question justice. In essence we came to the conclusion that planning how to run a cat club is a left hemisphere task that is appropriate to ask a left hemisphere inspired piece of software, learning how to be brave, that is a human task best left to exploration through a relationship with another human. When the moments for you to risk yourself and be brave appear you will know through your right hemisphere, your intuition will guide you.</p><p>We came to that conclusion together; here I am not a teacher, but a mentor. Teachers will soon be displaced, not because AI tutoring software will usher in a new way of learning that is mediated through the screen, but because teachers are poor replacements for AI software. Relative to AI software teachers are information-poor examples of a left hemisphere resource, but mentors, those who focus as much on right hemisphere thinking as left hemisphere thinking, will be in high demand.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></p><p>Those who can help integrate young people&#8217;s hemispheres to work in tandem, those who can help young people to conceive of living holistically integral lives of mind, body and soul, will be the future adults working in education.</p><p>In her insistence that the model probably won&#8217;t help her be brave, this young girl knows already that knowledge is not done unto, but sees her relationship with knowledge as a creative and experimental part of her self-expression, and is exploring the idea that knowledge is sometimes best done with technology, but sometimes best left in community with other humans.</p><p>Maybe the real bottleneck is our left hemisphere obsessed culture and our children not having a space to explore what a holistic notion of the good life might look and the freedom to play with that by expressing who they think they really are. Self-directed learning communities allow children the freedom to not only debate contemporary technology and the cutting-edge tools of their society whenever they want to, but play with them as active agents in charge of their own learning whilst also having the space to explore goals that pertain to the full breadth of what it means to be a human. It is through that iterative self-directed process that they come to understand better who they are and who they want to become.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e7d4b4-ba49-4e6d-884a-ec65bcc987f4_4608x2592.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">I fed the caption "friend going on bus to Whitby fish market" into that old algorithm the human brain and asked it to output me an image in no more than five seconds.

It lifted the veil. In other ways the increasingly authoritarian nature of mainstream education is meaning that neurodivergent young people are being held in tighter and tighter ways and that is leading to a massive increase in children who are suffering from poor mental health due to school trauma.</p></div></div><div class="footnote"><a id="footnote-4" href="#footnote-anchor-4" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">4</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>This essay is about the tool of large language models being used in goal setting but the most revolutionary part of this essay is tucked away in this sentence. The stale notion of learning maths by rote is still with us as it was with the Victorians who designed our system of education. And here we are still going through geometry as the Ancient Greeks did instead of freeing up children to become active questioners of the world they are inhabiting.</p><p>I would also add that though this essay focuses on the benefits that AI can have for self-directed young people I am not claiming that AI is a benevolent force in the world. There are also obvious concerns with the development of tools with such potential power and these are starting points for discussions that young people can have. The tool needs to be explored by playing with it up close and the concerns need to be explored by playing with them in conversation up even closer.</p></div></div><div class="footnote"><a id="footnote-5" href="#footnote-anchor-5" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">5</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>In another <a href="https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/gpt-3#footnote-1-57336127">post </a>on large language models Henrik Karlsson sees large language models as &#8220;tools to increase the speed at which you can execute ideas.&#8221; And that &#8220;when navigating the internet by conversing with an AI, you can more rapidly navigate into weird places by asking repeated follow-up questions than you could on the base layer internet.&#8221;</p></div></div><div class="footnote"><a id="footnote-6" href="#footnote-anchor-6" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">6</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Though there is someone who is interested in Japanese folklore I haven&#8217;t sought their consent, so these are not the actual prompts we used together, but after a few hours working with young people using Chat-GPT to help in the creation of mini-projects I can see how when the skill of what might make a useful prompt is learnt, this kind of narrowing in on potential actions to take to achieve a stated goal is relatively easy to do and extremely quick to complete.</p><p>Young people don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. They might know what they want to know, but the not know what it is about the unknown that they do not know. They are wandering around with all this desire like Donald Rumsfeld. Our job as mentors, in a sane culture the job of society, is to unlock that desire by making easy paths to explore unknowns. With only three of us working in the space the chances that we will be able to advise people just from what we already know is unlikely. We are always doing research to help support people.

The idea of using Chat-GPT with them was to provide them with a potential tool so they could do learning sprints on their goals and build out task lists at home without a mentor. They could then bring their work in and we could review it together afterwards. As Chat-GPT saves each chat we could look back over their inputs with them and ask them what made you make that decision there, what could have happened differently if you had changed that particular input half way down and where might that have taken you?</p></div></div><div class="footnote"><a id="footnote-8" href="#footnote-anchor-8" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">8</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>The difference in compatibility between things I want to know, skills I want to have and things I want to do is stark: the tool is generally best applied to things that people want to know.

You won&#8217;t exactly be welcome in it, so don&#8217;t sink into the couch or pull up a chair in the kitchen. Still, it&#8217;s important that you see this, so find a shadow and skulk: make sure you can see the single lamp in the corner, casting jaundiced light from an upturned shade. Keep an eye on the desk in the shadowed room to your right; the heavy old Sauder made of dark plywood, with sharp cubbyholes and heavy drawers where you might lose a bill forever. Or maybe entomb a muse that isn&#8217;t doing its job.</p><p>A drawer squeaks, slams. A clatter from the darkness announces someone hard at work on a keyboard. A printer spins up and whirs over the squeak of a chair.</p><p>The man who gets up from this desk might be your age, maybe a little older. He&#8217;s on the lean side, lanky in a way that worries you. He keeps his sleeves rolled up, his face unshaven. He combs his graying hair to one side, wipes and worries his thick glasses. Tonight, we&#8217;re going to watch him die.</p><p>Jon Egovic steps past you into the kitchen and hands a sheaf of stapled papers to the woman waiting there. Her small features glow in the television light, as she watches a dozen people leisurely pulling cakes from ovens arrayed in a green English garden. She&#8217;s shorter than him, but her spine is straighter. In fact, everything about her looks a little more defiant of gravity than everything about him. She turns off the bakers, takes the papers, and lays them on the island, leaning in close to scan them.</p><p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Jon asks while she&#8217;s reading.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Really good.&#8221;</p><p>You might notice the air sweeten as she says this, becoming warm, nutty. Like rising yeast and cinnamon; egg-washed monkey bread turning gold in the oven. Hold on to that. It&#8217;s an important trick of this place.</p><p>&#8220;Just really good?&#8221;</p><p>Jon isn&#8217;t <em>displeased, </em>exactly, by the smell in the air. Monkey bread is great. Homey, hand-made compliments have their charm. But where&#8217;s the milky unctuousness soaking the bread? Something like, &#8220;You&#8217;ve really outdone yourself,&#8221; or, &#8220;God, I forget how talented you are sometimes.&#8221; Is it too much to ask for the nutmeg zip, the sly citrus tang of a word like &#8220;genius,&#8221; furtively spoken?</p><p>His stomach rumbles, but he can&#8217;t eat frigging<em> bread </em>now<em>, </em>knowing what he really wants.</p><p>(Again, I remind you, this is a man about to die. Or a man about to <em>choose</em> death, which is arguably more horrifying. Jon Egovic is going to starve himself to death.)</p><p>His partner wrinkles her nose as he tries to explain his appetite. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I like it. I do. But you know I don&#8217;t gush.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You could, though,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I mean, you could a little. Give me more detail?&#8221;</p><p>She shakes her head, apologetic, and he waves it off. There&#8217;s no point going around like this. She&#8217;s not a <em>bad </em>reader, only incurious, and more than a little stubborn. She falls back on the very basics of nourishment. And that&#8217;s fine for a lot of people. Just, not for him. He&#8217;s not asking her for anything Michelin level. Maybe a little gourmet, a little upscale, sometimes. This&#8217;ll be easier if he finds her a recipe.</p><p>He opens his blog and scrolls through the comments. People have left him plenty of worthy meals in the past; he can always ask her to make one of those once in a while: &#8220;This is great!&#8221; &#8220;So dense, yet it never drags.&#8221; &#8220;Thought provoking.&#8221; &#8220;Amazing.&#8221; &#8220;Inspiring.&#8221; &#8220;I love it.&#8221;</p><p>Jon chews through the morsels again. Was the flavor always this&#8230;dull? Sure, the words are buttery, well-salted. But they&#8217;re lacking spice. A crack of pepper. He carves into the word &#8220;inspiring&#8221; and realizes that part of the problem is the cut. You need to braise a word like that to make it really palatable, and this one just tastes&#8230;dry.</p><p>He hesitates for only a moment before clicking over to a rival blog. No one knows they&#8217;re in rivalry with him, of course, and he&#8217;s not about to tell them. But he passes by their window almost every day, looking at what&#8217;s being served. A word like &#8220;brilliant&#8221; just crackles differently in someone else&#8217;s comment section than it does in his. Why is that? Maybe his partner really does need to focus on technique after all.</p><p>But it&#8217;s more than that. &#8220;Your stories are exactly what I&#8217;m looking for.&#8221; &#8220;Your essays always make me feel so warm inside.&#8221; &#8220;I shared this with all my friends.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t regret subscribing; $50 well spent.&#8221; The quality is on a whole other level.</p><p>Jon&#8217;s stomach squeezes into a pit, like he hasn&#8217;t eaten in weeks. In a way, he really hasn&#8217;t. Not since he was in middle school, even. He still thinks about that time in the gym, his shoes squeaking across the floor to receive that ribbon and that special diploma in front of all the kids who weren&#8217;t as talented as he was. The pretty teacher smiled at him, clapped for him, spoke such honoring words&#8212;for him! It was like someone had served him a plate of perfectly grilled fish: tender, flaky, pearlescent flesh under crisp and blistered skin.</p><p>And then the other kid went up. And she smiled at him, clapped for him. Served him what, to Jon, sounded like all the sense and spectacle of a broiled filet, medium rare, ruby red through and through, soft to the teeth and charred to perfection. Superior to his own dish in every way.</p><p>He chews his own tongue and his mouth waters. He&#8217;s been chasing that steak for years. He&#8217;s even gotten it, sometimes, only to realize that it wasn&#8217;t really what he wanted. Not in the moment, anyway. Sometimes, someone else gets the fish, and then he realizes that that&#8217;s what he was hungry for, after all. Someone else gets a fire-grilled squab, or a bed of hand-pulled pasta. Meanwhile, people are always feeding Jon things he&#8217;s not hungry for. And he can&#8217;t <em>ask </em>for what he really wants, because that&#8217;s against the rules.</p><p>So, he never eats. He starves, little by little. And he&#8217;s getting tired of it.</p><p>He rifles through a few more blogs, through the recipes contained in the comments. He prints off the most promising ones. God, how are there so <em>many? </em>Of course these other artists are always getting the nourishment they need; they have so damn <em>much </em>to pick from. Compared to them, Jon feels like he&#8217;s been rationed to biscuits of hardtack, sailor food. Who&#8217;s cooking for these other guys?</p><p>One name catches his attention. The name of another writer, in his rival&#8217;s comments. She&#8217;s quite good herself: clipped and to the point, while being deeply attentive. She makes day to day life feel sacred, and he&#8217;s felt compelled to honor her with a meal from time to time. It&#8217;s always something a little exotic, something with a little curry or coriander in it; if he&#8217;s not being fed in the ways he wants, he at least needs to show off that he knows how to cook. Maybe some of that attention will come back his way. And her words <em>do </em>have zest and spice, when she gives them: she&#8217;s called him &#8220;a wonderful prosaist&#8221;, said he&#8217;s &#8220;lyrical&#8221; and &#8220;easy to read.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s nice. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s something. Like honey on the hardtack. She adds a little puff, a little crunch, a little glaze to his bland life. There&#8217;s love and flavor in the humble dishes she makes. She lacks technique, but that could be refined. Starting from <em>something </em>is better than nothing. He wonders how different life might be if he&#8217;d chosen someone more like her to &#8212;</p><p>He shakes off the thought. He&#8217;s got a responsibility. To be honest with his partner. To be clear about his needs, to teach her how she can nourish him. She&#8217;ll never know if he can&#8217;t say.</p><p>He takes the printouts back to the island. Red pen in hand, he starts cobbling together a rough nutritional plan in front of her. It&#8217;s not fancy, not perfect, but it&#8217;ll start, and he even feels hungry and eager as the right ingredients start to stand out: &#8220;Engrossing.&#8221; &#8220;Inspiring.&#8221; &#8220;Insightful.&#8221; &#8220;Provocative.&#8221; He teaches her how to distinguish protein and carbs, seasoning and sweet. Even the leafy vegetables of constructive criticism are palatable if sufficiently oiled with assurances that he&#8217;s a genius, if&#8230;</p><p>&#8220;Jon,&#8221; she says. &#8220;What the hell?&#8221;</p><p>He blinks. &#8220;I need this, babe.&#8221;</p><p>She flips the pages, trying to orient herself. She&#8217;s dumbfounded by the stack of papers, the color-coded adjectives.</p><p>He knows that look. He&#8217;s seen it before. He&#8217;s seen it a lot, actually. That teacher&#8217;s face, after he&#8217;d confronted her for treating him unequally. His own mother&#8217;s knotted brow, bewildered by his ever-escalating attempts to earn from her the same praise she always had for other children: &#8220;Aaron is very mature. Nicole is very polite. Don&#8217;t you see how Anna studies very hard?&#8221; How dare they all be so <em>shocked </em>at his idea that maybe, just maybe, if he got the same nourishment as everyone else, he could actually live up to their expectations?</p><p>He snatches a recipe from his partner&#8217;s hand and gathers up the rest with a sneer.</p><p>The snap of her hand on the marble stops him as he&#8217;s about to step back into the shadowed den. A <em>thwack </em>with a heavy scent: not spicy with anger or sour with resentment, but&#8230;fermented, with something closer to defeat. The same smell that wafts up at him every time he opens the drawer of his desk.</p><p>&#8220;Do you even hear yourself right now?&#8221; she says. &#8220;Do you hear how <em>insane </em>you sound when you&#8212;&#8221; She bites her tongue. Presses her nails into her palm. She slides off the stool, stands in front of him on their bad carpet, in the nauseous yellow lamplight. She makes him set the ream of recipes aside, takes his hands and says, &#8220;Jon, I don&#8217;t have much to say about art. I know what I like, and what I don&#8217;t. But your talent isn&#8217;t why I&#8217;m with you.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Well why not?&#8221; he says. It scares him, somehow, that there might be anything else. That his talent might be too missable to earn him love.</p><p>When she finally speaks, it&#8217;s with all the words he&#8217;s longing for: &#8220;Generous.&#8221; &#8220;Diligent.&#8221; &#8220;Empathetic.&#8221; &#8220;Gentle.&#8221; &#8220;Attentive.&#8221; &#8220;Imaginative.&#8221; All wrapped up in reasons he doesn&#8217;t recognize. She doesn&#8217;t actually have the right words, and she tells him as much; she&#8217;s pulling out all the stops, throwing everything in the pan and frying it all together. It&#8217;s&#8212;entrancing. It&#8217;s unexpected and rustic. Unevenly chopped, heavily seasoned, but full of heart. A gift.</p><p>He eats the meal one bite at a time. He savors it: the soft potato bits and the bites that snap like onions. Perfectly grilled meat, chased with sips of wine. And all of it so <em>practical</em>, blooming right in the heart of him. Even the criticisms add depth &#8212; the sweet and tart critiques of his ego and attention. He can eat this whole thing, mashing it all together into generous forkfulls.</p><p>&#8230; But it isn&#8217;t exactly a steak, is it. Certainly not a filet. Not the kind of thing you cut into and marvel at how it just falls apart in your mouth. The words prove tough and fibrous the longer he chews on them. They mean too many different things. &#8220;Gentleness&#8221; isn&#8217;t &#8220;genius&#8221;, after all. &#8220;Diligent&#8221; describes a mode, &#8220;generous&#8221; a style, but it doesn&#8217;t make him feel&#8230;special. He feels loved, but he doesn&#8217;t feel brilliant.</p><p>She turns to go. Once she&#8217;s shrouded in the shadows of the hall, he glides to the sink. He pushes with his tongue and lets the mouthful fall, washed down by a quiet stream of water. Is that the subtle bitterness of an ulterior motive he tastes? He flips on the garbage disposal, runs the faucet again. Forget high standards; he really just can&#8217;t stomach a compliment that isn&#8217;t about his <em>writing</em>.</p><p>If you&#8217;re still hidden, watching him vanish back into the den, maybe you&#8217;re wondering what you&#8217;ve just watched. Is Jon delusional? Is this really a world where we need words to sustain us?</p><p>I&#8217;m not sure it matters. All that matters is that Jon spat in the sink. He doesn&#8217;t know it&#8212;won&#8217;t know it for a long time&#8212;but this is the start of how he starves to death.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

If you flailed through algebra or geometry, grinding out grades without grasping underlying principles, it&#8217;s for you.</p><p>It&#8217;s also for me. I&#8217;m a risk management consultant. I can program. I majored in information security and wrote a paper on quantum cryptography in grad school.</p><p>But at age 14, I had as much chance of understanding algebra as I did of inventing the atomic bomb.</p><h3>E = M.C. Escher?</h3><p>Other academic subjects came easy. But an algebra word problem was like an M.C. Escher black hole, with staircases leading nowhere and signs pointing toward dead ends.</p><p>My parents hired a tutor. I sat at the dining room table with him, listened and nodded. I knew I was supposed to leave that table enlightened, problem solved for good.</p><p>It didn&#8217;t happen. I&#8217;d glimpse enlightenment, try to grab it with both hands, and feel it slip into ether. I could follow the steps my tutor laid out and arrive at a right answer, but back in the classroom, without his step-by-step guidance, I floundered. Algebra was like a dream never quite remembered. My brain was not ready. I felt stupid.</p><h3>A Pyramid on a Toothpick</h3><p>The next year was Geometry, which I did understand. A respite. (Fun fact: students often perform well in either geometry or algebra but struggle with the other subject.) Then Algebra II.</p><p>For me, Algebra II class felt like a pyramid built on top of a toothpick. I had no solid foundation. Once again, I sat at the dining room table with tutors, and I could see in their eyes that they knew I was lost. But my parents paid them, so they sat with me.</p><p>Then came calculus. I never should have taken AP Calculus. But it was expected. All the other AP students were in the class. My guidance counselor wanted me to look good to colleges. So I enrolled.</p><h3>(Dys)Functional Haze</h3><p>To this day I have no idea what happened in that classroom. I remember two things: the teacher&#8217;s name and the pretty, swirly &#8220;f&#8221; he would draw on the board to indicate a function, whatever that was. I got a B- by cramming for each quiz, memorizing specific steps, and then promptly forgetting everything. The smartest thing I did was refuse to take the AP Calculus exam.</p><p>In college, I avoided math almost entirely: I took only a required statistics course, and I remember my surprise when it wasn&#8217;t as hard as expected. I didn&#8217;t think any more about it. I simply moved on.</p><p>For the first seven years of my career, I carried around a false belief that became part of my identity: good at writing, bad at math. I&#8217;d proven it repeatedly in high school and didn&#8217;t see the need to prove it again.</p><h3>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to a Life Without Math...</h3><p>Then I decided to take the GRE and go to grad school. I hired a Princeton Review tutor, but within about 10 minutes of starting their baseline practice test, I realized something was different. This was what had given me so much trouble? I understood almost everything on the test. And it was easy.</p><p>I hadn&#8217;t looked at math in the intervening 10 years. I hadn&#8217;t practiced. But while I wasn&#8217;t looking, my brain had changed. My math GRE score wasn&#8217;t perfect, but nearly so&#8212;about eight light-years beyond where I was in high school.</p><p>In my grad-school economics class, I used calculus. Actually used it and understood it. I took grad-level statistics, finance and accounting, and decision making under uncertainty. I got an A+ in the uncertainty class. What had happened?</p><h3>One Size Fits No One</h3><p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m all that unusual. I suspect a lot of people get left behind by traditional educational models, which move at a single inexorable pace, leaving stragglers sprawled on the roadside.</p><p>This is a flawed system. Brains do not mature at a constant rate across people, in the exact same way, making the exact same connections. My best advice would be to embrace where you are, and accept that you may be somewhere quite different in several years. Somewhere you never thought you could reach.</p><p>Give yourself a break, and then give yourself time and space to be different. We all are.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

a memory of you passes
as azaleas bloom

viewing the sunset this evening
thankful the god don&#8217;t charge money

bike ride home
counting the miles between us
me and the moon

such passionate love songs
the chorus of the frogs

morning walk
both a/c and bugs humming
this southern life

both a blessing and a curse
this cold soda pop

rain shower
memories of you pass
drop by drop
trying to collect water
in paper envelopes

tending the weeds
the past and future become muddled
i pour another drink

a new drinking buddy
every new memory 

table for one
ordering all your favorites
after your passing

trying to call home
skylark&#8217;s song

evening chill
unable to close the distance
your absence 

travelling miles and miles
within a single thought
short of breath
grateful for every moment with you
up these hills

considering all options
while being bedridden

the sun shines
no matter what
on us all

closing my my weary eyes
my face before i was born

No answer. He announced himself. Again, nothing. This time he used the back of his mag light, leaving no doubt to whose door was being knocked on. The patrolman flexed his toes and gently rocked back and forth, waiting the mandatory thirty seconds for someone to open, Scott was nothing if not careful. Times up. Scott called it in per protocol. Dispatch confirmed he would scout the perimeter and enter the premises and they would send a backup car. Can&#8217;t be too careful these days.</p><p>All the windows were shut, curtains drawn, and no lights could be seen on the main floor. A bit strange for this time of evening, the sun was well past dusk and one could expect a hallway light to be on at the very least. As chance would have it, the back door was not deadbolted and he was able to jimmy the back door open without much trouble, sometimes those old skills from his youth really paid off. He announced himself as soon as he stepped inside, held his breath, and waited for any response.</p><p>The silence was deafening. He snapped on his flashlight and took a quick scan of the laundry room he found himself in, damning himself for not checking the entrance for any footsteps. Luckily, there were none to be found. He opened the door and walked into the kitchen, the hardwood floor squeaking with each step. He clicked the light switch. A boring kitchen scene greeted him. A few dishes in the sink, a pan with some dried leftover pasta, two empty bottles of Chianti, but no sign of the Patterson&#8217;s.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone in town knew the Patterson&#8217;s, small towns are like that, but in their case, it was the tourist attraction that their home became that created their celebrity status in town. A haunted house. That was the rumors anyway. One the patrolman was all too familiar with, his thoughts getting the best of him as he continued checking the rest of the residence. Living room, empty. Den, empty. With each room cleared, his anxiety ratcheted up, the acid churning in his stomach. He made his way down the hallway and noticed the door to the attic was askew, his thoughts connecting dots previously unconnected. Every other room had the doors closed, including closets. He paused, facing the door, assessing his options and mapping out a course of action.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He continued down the hall towards the master bedroom, deciding to finish sweeping the main level before heading upstairs. He didn&#8217;t know why, but he got the feeling what he was after was up there. He didn&#8217;t like that feeling. The master bedroom was like the others, closed doors and nothing out of sorts. The attic then. He found himself at the door again and not moving. He reached for the door but stopped from opening it. Was he ready? He swallowed hard and steeled himself from what he may find up there. He instinctively drew his pistol and pulled his hand up with his flashlight crossed over, both pointing in the same direction. He softly used the toe of his boot to slowly push open the door, unconsciously holding his breath while he did so.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An old staircase greeted him, a forgotten and lonely part of the main house, the paint old and chipped, the only d&#233;cor a simple lightbulb dangling, falling from the ceiling. Typical. He ascended the stairs <em>creeaak</em> by <em>creeeaaakkk</em>, each step taking longer than the previous one. His nervous system was cranked up to eleven, palms sweating. Heart beating out of his chest. At last, he was at the top step and was met with another closed door. He faintly knocked and barely croaked out a timid hello, the moisture in his mouth having abandoned him at some point between step one and here. No answer. He turned the handle and gave the door a push. <em>Creeeaaaakkkkk.</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The partial moon gave enough light through the top window to cast deep shadows from right to left. Dusty curtains draped over unused furniture, boxes stacked to the ceiling, and a few forgotten chairs greeted Scott when he got his bearings. Footprints were scattered across the floor, taking center stage in the spotlight of his flashlight. The attic was long and this front portion gave no solace to the patrolman. He made his way to the walls to avoid messing with any potential evidence the footprints may provide and circled around the big furniture pieces in the center of the room. As he turned his flashlight past the furniture he froze. He had found the Patterson&#8217;s.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood. A lot of it. Scott had never seen so much blood except in the movies. His hands trembling as he took in the scene, two bodies sprawled on the floor, blood pooling on the ground underneath them. He fumbled for his radio and called it in between short gasps of air. Murder in his small town. How could this be? Who could&#8217;ve done it? He panned his flashlight against the back wall, noticing for the first time two words scrawled in blood. NEVER AGAIN!</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

The peace and love Easter niceties are over.

Barnsley Town Centre.</p><p>They don&#8217;t make shoes like they used to. They used to clack on the pavement, slap on the concrete. You know, everybody&nbsp;<em>knew</em>&nbsp;you were arriving two minutes before you arrived, as your clacking shoes echoed around the walls. They shook the bloody windows. A powerful and percussive echoing CLACK. And that&#8217;s partly why you wore them; to announce your presence and to annoy everyone else around you, like some kind of shoe trumpet, but the trumpet in this case is obviously the shoe, and not a trumpet at all. Alas, that was a long time ago. Shoes are all made of rubber now, made in factories in the far east, no idea of craftsmanship, and you couldn&#8217;t get your cobbler to fix them if you wanted him to. Instead of being shoe trumpets, they&#8217;re now closer to&#8212;if we&#8217;re pushed for a metaphor here&#8212;shoe bread. Lumpy, mouldy, three-day old, slightly soggy shoe bread. And these modern shoes lasted about as long as bread too. Bruce knew all this, of course. He wore good shoes, of course. Good old shoes that still clacked.&nbsp;</p><p>Clack. Clack.&nbsp;<br>Clack. Clack.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce, despite all the odds, had found himself in Barnsley. Yes,&nbsp;<em>that</em> Barnsley. That small northern town in England. Yes,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;Bruce. Bruce Forsyth. It was late at night and Bruce was walking through admiring the delights of Barnsley: the town that Barry Hines wrote&nbsp;<em>A Kestrel For A Knave</em>&nbsp;about, then made the movie&nbsp;<em>Kes</em>&nbsp;about, and the town that Parkinson pretended he wasn&#8217;t born in. Bruce had been doing &#8216;A Night With Bruce...&#8217; at the local small arena. He&#8217;d needed the money. Cobblers weren&#8217;t cheap these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Clack. Clack.&nbsp;<br>Clack. Clack.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce could hear something else beyond the reverberations of his own sartorial choices. He could hear some modern shoes, and if he wasn&#8217;t very much mistaken, they were those godawful Timberland things with the rubber anti-slip soles. They thumped. They sounded as if you&#8217;d tied wet bread to the bottoms of your feet. They were definitely shoe bread. Not a sophisticated shoe bread either, like a brioche or a ciabatta. No, Timberlands were more of a bargain bin shoe bread. Like, for example, a simple slice of white bread. Yes, that&#8217;s right. Timberlands were a simple slice of white shoe bread. Occasionally, the more expensive Timberlands were several slices of white shoe bread stacked on top of each other. A club sandwich of shoe bread, if you will.</p><p>Clack. Clack.&nbsp;<br>Thump. Thump.&nbsp;</p><p>Somebody was matching Bruce step for step, but Bruce didn&#8217;t turn around. He&#8217;d been in show business for 50 years, he didn&#8217;t need to turn around. People turned around for&nbsp;<em>him</em>. &#8216;Oh Bruce, do the thing,&#8217; they&#8217;d say, expecting him to perform like a octogenarian monkey. Besides, he was used to being followed. Presenting light entertainment shows on mainstream British television has its problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Clack-Clack. Clack-clack.&nbsp;<br>Thump. Thump.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce sped up, ever so slightly. He didn&#8217;t want the follower to notice the newfound agitation in his step. He chose instead to focus on his evening. The elegance to which he&#8217;d answered the stupid questions from the simple townsfolk:</p><p>&#8217;Bruce, why are you such a legend?&#8217; A bucktoothed backward bloated Barnsley man asked.&nbsp;</p><p>'Bruce, what&#8217;s it like working with Tess Daly?&#8217; A toothless and rather forward skinny man asked, with a knowing smile on his face. Well,&nbsp;<em>sort of</em>&nbsp;a smile. Is it still a smile if there&#8217;s no teeth present in the mouth? Isn&#8217;t that just a...shaped hole? Bruce shook away that particularly traumatic part of the evening.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce thought back to the small game show he hosted in the middle of the night, that was just to the left side of copyright infringement and absolutely not&nbsp;<em>The Price Is Right</em>. In fact, it was called&nbsp;<em>The Price Is Left</em>. And to top off the entire evening: The small waltz he&#8217;d performed at the end of the night to show he &#8216;still had it&#8217;, whatever &#8216;it&#8217; may be.&nbsp;</p><p>Clack-Clack. Clack-clack.&nbsp;<br>Thump-thump. Thump-thump.</p><p>The follower was speeding up and trying to match the step of Bruce. Bruce could sense the follower getting closer. Whoever it was, they weren&#8217;t just walking behind. They wanted to either speak to Bruce, mug him, or murder him. He tried to shake that thought out of his head by pulling his phone out of his pocket. He needed to find this damn hotel. He&#8217;d been told it was a five minute walk from the arena, but the panic had set in, and Bruce had lost track of where he was and how far he&#8217;d walked. He started to look over his shoulder every minute. He could see a silhouette in the distance now. A long dark coat. Dark trousers. Hood pulled up over the head. If you were to ask somebody to describe your average 3am murderer, they&#8217;d describe the follower that Bruce was currently looking at.&nbsp;</p><p>Clackity-clack. Clackity-clack.&nbsp;<br>Thumpity-thump. Thumpity-thump.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce looked down at his phone at Google Maps. A two minute walk to the hotel. He was going in the right direction. He&#8217;d started hopping every few steps now, in an attempt to walk faster, but not make it so obvious. He was sweating now too, small beads forming at Bruce&#8217;s temples. He glanced over his shoulder again. The dark, long jacket had come into focus now, Bruce could make out the material. Leather. The collar was turned up. Bruce was surprised to see the follower wearing a Balenciaga hoodie. If you&#8217;d planned to murder somebody, you probably didn&#8217;t want to be wearing your 500 quid hoodie. It&#8217;d be like going to the butchers in a tuxedo and asking to put a shift in. The light humour didn&#8217;t lighten Bruce&#8217;s mood. The follower was closer. Much closer.&nbsp;</p><p>Clack-clack-clack. Clack-clack-clack.&nbsp;<br>Thump-thump-thump. Thump-thump-thump.&nbsp;</p><p>Google Maps said one minute to the hotel. ETA: 3:14am. Bruce was all but running now, a strange shuffle run that only men far over 70 with knackered creaking knees and fused ankles and hips can sympathise with. He knew he couldn&#8217;t outrun the hooded probably-murderer. Bruce was sure now this chap didn&#8217;t have good intentions. If he could just keep shuffle running for another 30 seconds, he&#8217;d be there. The hotel appeared in front of Bruce, just as he looked over his shoulder. The follower was gone, and Bruce stopped. Turned around a full circle, to make sure the would-be murderer wasn&#8217;t hiding anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8217;Thank Christ for that,&#8217; Bruce sighed.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce spotted the hotel.&nbsp;</p><p>'Nice to see you, to see you-&#8216; Bruce started, but never finished, and that was for a very simple biological reason: Bruce had just died.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words: he&#8217;s a stiff. Bereft of life, he rests in peace. His metabolic processes are now history. He&#8217;s fallen off the perch. He&#8217;s kicked the bucket, he&#8217;s shuffled off his mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleeding choir invisible.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

It conjures all kinds of images and an ideal of old-fashioned, red-blooded storytelling to live up to. Fortunately- as todays submission shows- our man Frank Kidd is worthy of the name and of keeping that Pulp tradition alive, while weaving in some 21st century themes and tropes for good measure. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading more from Frank, as I hope you are now too.</p><p>&#8;Enjoy.</p><p><a href="https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/">~TJB.</a></p><div class="embedded-publication-wrap"

class="text">We stand on an overpass, the highway below abandoned. It stretches into the distance, an asphalt artery across a corpse. I take a bite of deer jerky found loose in my pocket. The child. My child picks up a piece of rubbish.

            "What is it Daddy?"

            "Put it down. Its broken."

            "But what is it?"

            I adjust the fur coat against frosty morning air. The highway is choked with abandoned cars. Still no sign of the runner. The morning silent. Peacefully so.

            "It's an answer box."

            "An answer box," she says to herself. "But what does it do?" she asks, looking up at me with blue saucer eyes, her nose running from the cold.

            "It doesn't do anything, anymore."

            "But what did it do?" she asks.

            I take the small rectangle from her hand, its glass face cracked. I trace the symbol on the back with my finger, an apple, like the one from the garden. 
            "People used to ask it for answers. Answers to anything. It would tell them what they wanted to hear," I say handing the box back to her.

            "Answer box, what game should I play today?" she asks it. When there is no reply she turns her saucers back to me. She punctuates the silent cry for help by wiping a little red nose on a puffy sleeve.

            "They don't work anymore, honey," I stifle a laugh. Her disappointment is cute, but she is still disappointed.

            "What happened to them?" she asks.

            "What happened to everything," I said. "We made machines that could think."

            She looks back at the answer box, and I look again for the runner.

            The triumph of science had been the death of it. They had no idea how it worked, only how to make it. At some point scientists became wizards, conjuring consciousness from a void of code. They had created a black hole and then trusted it with the world.

            The machines didn't rise up. They didn't roast the world in nuclear war. No, they did what we told them too, as best they could.

            Spirits in the machine.

            When they got sick, nobody knew why, and there was nobody left who could fix them. We had hoped the machines would fix themselves, the way they were "designed" too. But that didn't happen. And then it all fell away, not with a bang, but with a wheezing sigh. We were left out in the cold, adrift in the future, lost in a strange place with no idea how we got there. No way to trace our steps back. Every day we walked the corpses of useless machinery, the manuals to which, first locked behind paywalls, were now bricked and lost inside the answer boxes.

            The runner appears in the distance. He is no longer running but doggedly jogging. He brings news from the next city over. Of goings on there. But he also brings books, books to trade. Most are useless of course, either too advanced for someone missing the fundamentals, or too fundamental for someone needing the advanced.

            "Let's go, honey," I say.

            She skips along after me, and we meet the runner in the highway. It's a new guy.

            "What happened to Roger?" I ask.

            "Broke his leg," the runner says. "They tried to set it best they could, but nobody is quite sure how. I guess it&#8217;s all a guessing game now." He chuckles at the darkness of it all.

            I hand the runner one of our books, and he hands us theirs. It's the Art of Gardening. I pass him The Home Tanning and Leathermaking Guide.

            He turns it over in his hands, "Say you folks don't happen to have any medical books?"

            "I'll have to check," I say. "If we do, I'll bring it next time."

            This is how knowledge circulates now - slowly. The runner system brought peace after everything broke down. It was bad for a while, we fought over resources, over food and access to water. And then after that, we fought over knowledge. What had been the public library, was looted first, firebombed later. In war, depriving your enemy as good as victory.

            We watch the man leave, and I remember that I never got his name. He's too far up the highway now. I'll get it next week.

            We start back, and my shadow skips to catch up. Geese fly in a V overhead. Their honking breaks the morning stillness.

            "Why do they fly like that?" my shadow asks.

            "They fly like an arrow," I say. "Pointed makes it easier to fly."

            "Oh," comes the little reply.

            I can't tell if she is satisfied with my answer.

            "Why can birds fly, and we can't?"

            "They have hollow bones."

            "Oh."

            We walk in relative silence for a while. Up ahead is a bridge that crosses the river. We stop in the middle of it, and I wait for her to finish dropping rocks in the water. She pulls the answer box from her pocket and drops it over the side. Delight lights her face as it splashes into the water. A bigger splash than the pebbles made.

            "You didn't want that anymore?"

            "It was broken," she says, suddenly second guessing her decision. "Besides, I got you."

            "Yeah," I smile at that. "I guess, I'm your answer box, huh?"</pre></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>So that&#8217;s it for this week.

Stoeltzing</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>With California in my bones, I am no stranger to the taste of ash behind my teeth. But in mid-March, a splatter of rainfall is expected in Big Sur. That doesn&#8217;t stop me from trekking out from San Francisco with two girlfriends and a riot of camping gear in my car to make a temporary home of a campsite so scenic it&#8217;s obscene, pulled up kissing close to the coastline. Beyond it glittering, hypnotic, the Pacific Ocean. Neither does the threat of rain deter us from embarking on a midnight picnic that evening, though we are relieved to find the night remains clear.&nbsp;</p><p>The journey down to the beach from the campsite is a meandering one. We stomp loudly&#8212;if not a little drunkenly&#8212;down the path, scaring off any nearby wildlife as we go. Smooth a blanket over the sand, take turns pulling tarot cards. The friend of a friend who brought the deck pulled them from the camper van she lives in with her partner at the campground; she led us here, through the inky dark, and now reads from the guidebook, sharing what knowledge it holds for each beautifully illustrated card. When my turn comes, I don&#8217;t pull one. I am the only one not to do so. I regularly pull from my own deck, enough so that I&#8217;m tired of demanding answers from elsewhere. I am tired of feeling I have nothing definitive to offer myself.&nbsp;</p><p>My friend D and I separate from the other girls, clambering down the bluff to lay claim to an immense weathered log. We are a sleepy warm tumble of tequila and other substances, having scarfed down the mushroom chocolates near the warm sputter of campfire, having brought a second round to drink in a double-walled thermos.</p><p>The moon bleaches the scene, spilling its bone-white light through a sieve of night sky. It has long peeled away the glare of daytime, turning a lambent gaze over the sand and the sea, over my limbs which feel oddly but peaceably distant; I am serene with the knowledge that I can tuck them away, keep them like secrets in my pocket. I could do the same with the moon, zip it into my sleeping bag with me, curl up against the cold&#8212;and it does get cold. Later, though, in the tent.&nbsp;</p><p>For now I am tranquil. Sheer as a wraith. And I can hear this underlying hum to everything, not like the feeling of being watched&#8212;not entirely&#8212;though many a writer has explicated the shivery sensation of strange gazes on them here, the shapes of tall, spectral figures on the mountain. It&#8217;s more that we are being <em>allowed, </em>bestowed with safety and presence. I give D Reiki as she leans on me, both our bodies pressing against the log, my hand steady on the top of her head. The moon is giving me Reiki, too.&nbsp;</p><p>There is an attractive Desi couple that arrived earlier that day to camp in the spot next to ours. They brought their young daughter, who earlier showed me a Disney movie on her iPad, who played her game of animal bingo with me. The colorful creatures smile from the scorecard, matching tokens winking back.</p><p>On a day not too far in the future, these will become memories she mines for meaning. Or maybe she won&#8217;t. She may simply associate them with the blur of emotions attached to the day. The simple happiness of play. The small magic of watching a vibrant animated film that became an instant favorite. Bunny rabbits that scamper through the bush, birds that ride the sea breeze through a pastel wash of sunset, and towering cliffs that spit out their waterfall, uncaring of their fame.</p><p>The summer I first camped in Big Sur with my family, having just learned to climb trees, I spent the entire time playing monkey overhead, palms pressed to peeling bark. The summer I read Francesca Lia Block&#8217;s <em>Witch Baby </em>for the first time, I saw myself in her tangle of curls, an electricity of tempestuousness, even developing an obsession with eating entire boxes of Fig Newtons at a time. Same way she did. The summer I first batted hunger back and forth, like a beaten animal, like skin stretched tight as a drum. I could hold my hip bones like hands, like flowers&#8212;offerings for an altar to which I did not yet know I prayed.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the summer I turned twelve, or was it fourteen? One of my mother&#8217;s friends said something about the way I looked in Farsi, a phrase I couldn&#8217;t quite grasp. When I asked my mom, she relayed that in English, it meant &#8220;I looked like water.&#8221; As if anyone could peer right through me. As if something about me appeared unclear, my outlines blurry, wavering. And yet, water is a force. I spent hours swimming laps in the pool, intent upon only this: How many calories could each lap burn? I liked the slice of each movement, the way it made my mind quiet, my body pliant. I looked like water, but felt like so much ash.</p><p>Every memory I have of myself at that age&#8212;twelve and thirteen and fourteen&#8212;has taken on the shape of that particular melancholy. I could taste it like blood at the back of the mouth, an open wound that stretched and reshaped itself, silent and looming until it was not, until it was simply there and there and There, the same way the hunger was. Would I pass the violence of this inner abyss on to a child? How could I want something so deeply when I was so afraid of it?&nbsp;</p><p>In Big Sur, I can&#8217;t explain my frustration, or maybe it&#8217;s that I don&#8217;t want to. It comes on sudden and bottomless; but the witching hour threads itself along our hair, our spines, and I am grateful for my ghosts, grateful that I can feel my appetite at all, and that it&#8217;s always been more than physicality alone. It doesn&#8217;t stop or end, it transforms once and then again.</p><p>And isn&#8217;t California ravenous, too, in its way? The sea unhinges its jaw to swallow itself, the horizon; what wildness of sky and saltwater hasn&#8217;t been devoured meets the shoreline in an embrace, an expanse. They say living here makes you soft, but I painstakingly braided steel into my backbone long ago, and I revel in the cool breath of this night on my skin.&nbsp;</p><p>The next morning dawns to the little girl waving goodbye from across the campsite. Her parents quickly stow any remaining supplies into the trunk of their car with the ease of familiarity that graces that kind of outdoorsy family. Their daughter waves, calls goodbye, and I respond in kind. She is younger than I was when it began.</p><p>My friends are staying another night, but I head home in an onslaught of rain as bone-white and faded as a years-old scar. I drive, riding hard on the curves of the cliffside, still thinking of yesterday&#8217;s moonlight, as silvery as the stray tendrils of gray rising from my temples. Thinking of the way we learn to pray to ourselves on ephemeral altars, ones that are built and soon destroyed, built and then destroyed, crumbling more quickly than we can bear. And yet, we can take the stars from the sky when we remember to, or else offer them our secrets anew.&nbsp;</p><p>The awaited deluge has come, and I remember myself.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

from all metropolitan things slumbers a little village. If you take a few more steps north you&#8217;ll be in the true wilderness where forests and lakes and marshes cover the landscape. A wilderness where the concept of silence takes on a whole new meaning. Where the <a href="https://luontoportti.com/en/t/596/curlew">curlew&#8217;s flight call </a>digs itself into the human soul and forms an eternal and melancholy bond so strong that the human will long of the flight call every spring, no matter how far away she is from that country in the far North.</p><p>The village has a couple of thousand inhabitants and no street lights. Potholed and narrow countryside roads meander along old cow paths and a river that empties out into the ocean about half an hour away. Most villagers are descendants of farmers and in the 1970s some still didn&#8217;t have indoor plumbing. This is a story about a woman from such a village. Such a village can, of course, exist about anywhere in the world and this story could of course also be about a man.</p><p>This one happened to be a beautiful village when the woman grew up, and it still is for that matter. The light summer nights were fragrant with all things in bloom, and the winter nights were lit up by aurora borealis and stars so bright they almost guided one&#8217;s way back home through the dark forest. It was a safe village, far away from dangerous things, where children could walk home alone and roam around as children do.</p><p>We&#8217;ll jump into this reality and zoom in on a blue Honda Civic as it zips through the lush Northern countryside. It is midsummer and the peak of beauty in this village. Poems wouldn&#8217;t do it justice, though local poets and songwriters have tried and come close. Nowadays, if they knew this place existed, influencers would flock to this place and stand, no sprawl, in the ditches among the wildflowers as the midnight sun teases the horizon. But wait, we need to focus on the blue Honda.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg" width="1456" height="2175" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2175,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3007122,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff30e949f-2484-46c5-8f7f-0259cbac653b_3357x5014.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/ko/@jhonkasalo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Joakim Honkasalo</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/AgZjK8wgwuU?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>That last rolling hill along the beat up countryside road has begun to tempt her. What if she kept going instead of turning home? Into a future of possibilities and new beginnings.</p><p>Her car is her freedom as she navigates through the <a href="https://youtu.be/Gu9HhYv0C7E">teenage wasteland</a>. It&#8217;s a stick shift and fast. Sometimes she pretends she is one of the strong female leads in one of the American movies she loves to watch, like Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor. Some of them would keep going, she knows that. She is, deep in her soul, a pilot, and she was meant to explore. If she was born in a parallel universe she might have been the captain of a space exploring ship. Like Captain Janeway&#8230;</p><p>Halfway up the hill she still isn&#8217;t sure what will happen. She senses the temptation to keep going, and suspects it one day will win. The urge for something grander is growing stronger each day. In the very last moment she turns right, and onto the narrow road through the pine tree forest and home. A brief sense of regret flushes through her, but is soon erased by other thoughts.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg" width="1456" height="2588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2588,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1482638,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85101510-b4dd-44af-9235-f71521ccda90_3376x6000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@iwearprada?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Remo Vilkko</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/t83CyLxdnp4?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Sometimes she bikes through the warm summer evenings for hours. Fast, on an old bike. Her friends rarely call her anymore. To appear a bit less alone, she dresses as if she&#8217;s on her way somewhere, like to a party or something. She isn&#8217;t. Somehow she finds herself in a solitary cocoon with no close friends and a dear wish to have at least one good friend. She bikes along the prettiest bike routes in the seaside town, and breathes in through her nose and out her mouth.</p><p>Her legs burn as she pedals faster than necessary uphill. She tells herself it will strengthen her lungs and legs for the future. She will need strength in the future, she senses it. Then back on shaky and tired legs to the pad that has no AC to dream and read and write some more.</p><p>All this beauty and safety, she grasps. The sweet smell of birch trees after rain. The curlew&#8217;s cry in the twilight expresses safety and calm. The quiet snow piles that hide everything dead and ugly. The stars and aurora borealis that many dream of seeing and never will. The village, the town, the city - a microchip that has left her out of the circuits. It is good to live here in the quiet corner of this planet, but she knows this isn&#8217;t for her. It is that simple. She is meant for something else. Something difficult.</p><p>In the spring, when the fields begin to steam in the sunlight, and the soil wakes up, the scent from the earth tells her something <em>will</em> happen. She doesn&#8217;t speak earth, but she understands that she won&#8217;t remain here to guard these fields. They are beautiful, but they are not for her. The spider silk strong call of the curlew almost holds her back. It knows its way deep into her soul, but she doesn&#8217;t speak curlew and allows the melancholy sound to vanish behind the aspen and willow in the valley.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg" width="1456" height="1820" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1820,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2432283,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14ca4968-c01b-4fef-949e-f82d37c497a5_3244x4055.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@austincppc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Peng Chen</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/qd-dvtbS45Q?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Time moves slower when young so we can better grasp the true meaning of solitude later on when we encounter it. It is important to be lonely with big dreams. Perhaps even necessary. All this happens right at the dawn of internet, when universities are the only institutions where young people can experience the new thrill of being online. This is where she forges her first deep friendship with another human. So, they do exist, the humans that understand her.</p><p>She wonders about her lack of meaningful friendships. Is she a poor friend? Has she done something to make herself unattractive to new friendships? Has she - and this is not yet in her realm of thought - stepped outside the circle of recognition and into something others nearby will not or do not want to follow? She makes attempt after attempt to connect, befriend, rejoin, invite, communicate and be part of the local life. Failed beginnings and humiliating events take place which further push her into the opaque membrane that only she is leaning against. It is the border between now and the future.</p><p>She tries to find an opening in this membrane to the future. At 4 a.m., after walking home through the birch forest after one rare pleasant evening out, she stands on the yard and listens to the distant hum of big rigs far away on the highway. The big rigs are sirens&#8217; calls. She has everything and nothing where she stands now. She is aware of her good and safe life, and she feels immensely grateful that she has this particular life to life. It is, however, out there where she belongs, somewhere where there is a hum. Everything here is in a stasis. The dead end meets her again and again. The decision arrives to her. A boulder from the ice age sets into a slow and steady motion. She can feel it. It feels good.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg" width="1456" height="2184" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2184,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3816894,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf50692b-b6b8-4eaf-b527-75a3b30356c7_4000x6000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@julianhochgesang?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Julian Hochgesang</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/xAtPFINNagQ?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>When she tells them she is leaving they express surprise. She isn't surprised but understands. She has left many times before. As many times as she has driven up the last rolling hill and turned right, she has, in her dreams, continued along the road into the future. As many times as she has driven up the last rolling hill and turned right, she has, in reality, taken other roads too. Nearby roads with nearby people, but there was never anyone in this village who was up for an adventure beyond all this. So she got in her car, left a dust cloud behind her on the forest road, and did it solo. She is after all the pilot of her own life.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

And when it comes to such fun days out with eating, drinking and merriment I find that a train journey is always involved at some point.</p><p>Maybe that&#8217;s just me though.</p><p>In any case, trains are a great subject for the writer and the artist as this months Symposium shows. Trains have a real romance to them (or at least they can do) and they have a way of really sparking the creative imagination, which is demonstrated by the essay to fiction ration in this months offering. (Although this may reflect the way that the STSC collective is going more generally as more and more people try their hand at storytelling and find that there is no other creative act quite like it).</p><p>Trains can be a quotidian part of the daily commute or they can be the means of having a whole new experience and seeing a whole new landscape out of the window. Ordinary and yet extraordinary. An accessible means of contemplation. An often underappreciated aspect of the modern human condition. You can see why we were drawn to this topic.</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p><a href="https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/">~TJB</a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

The multi-talented, medium-spanning Trilety (see the painting below) has done it again. Amazing work.</p><h3><a href="https://vitabenes.substack.com/p/train-peace">Train peace by Vita</a></h3><blockquote><p>But besides the technological wonder that trains represented (and that we tend to overlook nowadays), there is another kind of specialness to them. <strong>When you're on a train, you're exactly where you need to be</strong></p></blockquote><p>Part of the beauty of the essay as a medium is that it can be an excellent vehicle for conveying the sense of wonder that so much of our lives would make us feel if we let go of our jadedness and truly paid attention to the world around us. Vita&#8217;s latest has this quality in spades. </p><h3><a href="https://iamnotmakingup.com/2023/03/31/terminus-the-brief-encounter-concerto/">Terminus by White Rose</a></h3><p>I was wondering if anyone was going to tackle David Lean&#8217;s train based masterpiece <em>Brief Encounter</em> as part of this months symposium. I was not disappointed. This is an absolutely wonderful piece, so good in fact that I now feel compelled to rewatch <em>Brief Encounter</em> in all of its repressed, unspoken, monochrome romantic glory. </p><h3><a href="https://yardenaschwersky.substack.com/p/memory-trains?utm_source=%2Finbox&amp;utm_medium=reader2">Memory Trains By Yardena</a></h3><blockquote><p>The clattering and screeching of that hulking metal beast as it lumbered through the dark became a lullaby. Somewhere in the night, someone else was awake, guiding that creature. At that moment, we inhabited the same space.</p></blockquote><p>A short but extremely evocative piece, this. You can really hear everything that is being described. Makes it seem easy to write this well.</p><h3><a href="https://terryfreedman.substack.com/p/trains">Trains: An Oulipian exercise by Terry</a></h3><p>I AM WRITING THIS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE I FORGOT TO INCLUDE THIS PIECE BY TERRY WHEN I FIRST EMAILED THIS SYMPOSIUM OUT AND SO I FEEL DUTYBOUND TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IT. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL MAKE YOU READ THIS OULIPIAN TEXT AND SUBSCRIBE TO TERRY&#8217;S SUBSTACK AND THEN AMENDS WILL HAVE BEEN MADE. THANK YOU.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Fiction</h2><h3><a href="https://www.ioann.xyz/p/training-memory">Training Memory by Vanya</a></h3><blockquote><p>As he listened to the lulling clanking of a train, Qzm Qvyd sat next to his father and gazed at his homevillage of Tryv&#237;ra retreating into the distance, nestled among the balding knolls, the same knolls where he witnessed his birth and boyhood.</p></blockquote><p>That is about as Vanya an opening sentence as you can get. He has essentially created his own style and genre at this point. And no, I have no idea how you pronounce that name!</p><h3><a href="https://acabinetofcuriosities.substack.com/p/the-gold-coins-of-lebreton?sd=pf">The Gold Coins of LeBreton by Minna</a></h3><p>Everything about this- the prose, the images, the structure- was an absolute delight to take in. This is up there with Minna&#8217;s best work to date, which is saying something.</p><h3><a href="https://yueliansdrafts.substack.com/p/frankfurt-by-train">frankfurt by train by Yuelian</a></h3><p>This tiny story is right up my alley- it&#8217;s about nothing and everything, it captures a moment perfectly and in doing so helps us to reflect on all kinds of moments of our own.</p><h3><a href="https://edwardrooster.substack.com/p/a-rest-stop-in-a-long-valley">A Rest Stop In A Long Valley by Edward</a></h3><p>Like few writers I have ever encountered Edward is creating whole worlds, a whole universe with his prodigious output. It&#8217;s incredible. Quantity and quality both, an extremely rare feat.</p><h3><a href="https://fictitious.substack.com/p/before-and-after">Before and after by Oleg</a></h3><p>Extremely evocative work here from Oleg. He has one of the keenest eyes and feel for the perfect visual detail around. It makes you go back to his stories again and again.</p><h3><a href="https://clintavo.substack.com/p/the-dreamer">The Dreamer by Clint</a></h3><p>Even without the secret cheat code of referencing Miles Davis and John Coltrane playing on Freddie Freeloader (a step guaranteed to make me be kindly disposed to the writing in question) this is a fantastic story by Clint who is proving himself something of a dark horse in the STSC story writing stakes.</p><h3><a href="https://dcreed.substack.com/p/slow-train">Slow Train by Victor D. Sandiego</a></h3><p>I saw the title. I saw the opening photograph. I had a particular hope for what style and mood this piece would turn out to have. And this story delivered on that and exceeded it. I love it when that happens.</p><h3><a href="https://polarisdib.substack.com/p/derailment?sd=pf">Derailment by D.B.</a></h3><blockquote><p>The following story is gross and disturbing.</p></blockquote><p>He&#8217;s not lying! But modesty, I suppose, also stopped our man D.B. from mentioning that his contribution is gross, disturbing <em>and </em>very, very good. Another STSC member proves that they have real storytelling chops.</p><h3><a href="https://pulpvitalist.substack.com/p/the-last-son-of-rome?utm_source=direct&amp;r=1qbiay&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">The Last Son of Rome by Frank Kidd</a></h3><p><a href="https://pulpvitalist.substack.com/">The Pulp Vitalist</a> proves that he is worthy of the name with this intergalactic flash fiction take on the &#8216;trains&#8217; prompt. He pulls it off and the absolutely fantastic aesthetics and images that accompany the story don&#8217;t hurt either.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><h2>Art and Poetry</h2><h3>Mixed media on canvas - 24x20" by Trilety Wade</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png" width="757" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:757,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:932160,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab21518c-3a0f-4fe4-b860-94d59fb3a59b_757x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><h3><a href="https://jamesmaynard.substack.com/p/pipedream-the-orange-line-portland">Pipedream | The Orange Line, Portland, Oregon</a> by James Maynard</h3><p>Even after having read dozens of his sonnets by this point I am still consistently amazed by James&#8217; technical ability, inventiveness and imagery.

Three days had passed, his rain coat was caked in bile, blood, and the filth of the city.</p><p>His work boots left muddy foot prints on the otherwise pristine floors of the corporate high rise. The young woman at reception began to gag as Jeffrey approached. He stood there tall and rough, slamming the gym bag on the desk.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here to see Mr. Bronson,&#8221; Jeffrey said trying to keep himself from collapsing due to his exhaustion.</p><p>The poor woman belched and expelled bits of her lunch in the waste basket next to her. The lobby became flooded with the reek of the bag.</p><p>&#8220;Name?&#8221;, she squeaked</p><p>&#8220;Jeff Morenz. I&#8217;m here for my interview.&#8221;</p><p>She picked up the phone, keeping a hand over her nose and mouth.</p><p>She muttered in an uneasy tone of voice, &#8220;Jeff Morenz is here to see you sir. Yes sir, his third interview.&#8221;</p><p>She put down the phone. &#8220;Go on up,&#8221; she coughed, &#8220;Level 12. Executive Boardroom.&#8221;</p><p>Jeffrey threw the bag over his shoulder and trekked his way to the elevator.</p><p>Inside, he turned and watched the neon city lights through the glass as he ascended to the top floor. Normally he&#8217;d be home, walking with Tia in the cold, wet night.</p><p>Things were different now.</p><p>The economy went south. He lost his income, his apartment, girlfriend, and whatever moral virtue he had left in him. Everything he once owned was sold at auction, though it made no difference. Work opportunities were drying up and only a few of the larger firms were open to hiring. Eight months of rejections and failed interviews were enough to make any penniless man desperate.</p><p>He needed something, anything, to bring him back to his normal life. As the chimes rang with each passing floor, Jeffrey took a deep, long breath and starred at the gym bag. Funny, he always considered himself a pacifist, one who would speak out against violence and thought himself above such vile behavior. But when times are tough, when food, housing, and jobs are scarce, a man&#8217;s thoughts center only on his own survival.</p><p>Level 12.</p><p>The doors opened. Jeffrey took his bag and marched forward, walking through the opulent hallway of Southern Gothic tradition and decorative displays of animal heads encased in gold.</p><p>He stopped at the mahogany French doors, knocked three times, and waited. Seconds felt like a lifetime but soon the doors parted. Walking in the darkly lit room, Jeffrey was met by the partners, Mr. Stanley and Mr. Graf, siting in their plush leather chairs at the end of a conference table. In the back near the bar, an older man, maybe late 60s, suited in a sharkskin gray vest, pants, crisp white shirt, and regal magenta tie poured himself another glass of bourbon.</p><p>Jeffrey nearly collapsed at the end of the table.</p><p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;ll be damned,&#8221; the old man in gray smiled and carried a southern gentlemanly air about him.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here for the interview, Mr. Bronson&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Take a seat, my boy! Seems like you&#8217;ve earned it.&#8221; Bronson&#8217;s voice was baked in Tennessee sunshine.</p><p>Jeffrey climbed to the leather chair by his side and pulled the gym bag up on the table.</p><p>&#8220;Drink?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Water. Please.&#8221;</p><p>A quick snap of the old man&#8217;s fingers and a large glass pitcher of water appeared at the end of the table. Jeffrey grabbed the pitcher with both hands and nearly drowned himself trying to drink as much as he could.</p><p>&#8220;Something to eat?&#8221;</p><p>Mr. Bronson whistled and a half rack of pork ribs, warm, smoky and dripping in bbq sauce materialized before Jeffrey. The poor hungry fool couldn't stuff his face fast enough.</p><p>The older men laughed watching this sad display. Mr. Stanley leaned forward and smiled</p><p>&#8220;Well fellas,&#8221; the portly partner&#8217;s voice was thick and guttural. &#8220;What do we think young Jeffrey has brought us in the bag?&#8221;</p><p>He rubbed his pudgy, sweaty hands together in such delight.</p><p>&#8220;Smells ripe to me,&#8221; Mr. Graf, who sat back in his chair with a nasally voice and rat-like face, took in the foul aroma with great pleasure. His eyes were hidden behind dark oval glasses. He smiled showing off his set of golden teeth.</p><p>&#8220;Well Jeff,&#8221; Mr Bronson said, &#8220;what's in the bag?&#8221;</p><p>Jeffrey took his sauce covered fingers and pulled down the bag&#8217;s zipper. He emptied it.</p><p>Four heads rolled on to the conference table.</p><p>Eyes removed from their orbital sockets. Four rotting green faces, three men, one former blonde. Mr. Stanley and Mr. Graf rose to their feet in a roaring cheer and applause.</p><p>&#8220;My my,&#8221; Mr. Bronson said &#8220;You actually delivered. Well done, Jeffrey! I admit I'm surprised. The others candidates shied away from such a task.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Not afraid of a little blood sport eh,&#8221; laughed Mr. Graf as he caressed one of the decomposed heads.</p><p>Jeffrey stood up, &#8220;I did what you asked. Do I get the job?&#8221;</p><p>Bronson smiled, &#8220;Well Jeffrey, this does make for a marvelous offering. Bringing us the heads of the other candidates is quite creative, quite creative indeed.</p><p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Jeffrey clutched at the empty soiled bag.</p><p>An obscure whisper in a strange tongue shook through the room. Mr. Bronson nodded in agreement.</p><p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the firm is also going through cuts. Bad times I&#8217;m afraid. But good luck in your job hunt.&#8221;</p><p>Jeffrey was closed to tears. This is not how it was supposed to end for him. The blood wouldn&#8217;t leave his hands now. He fell to his knees.</p><p>&#8220;Please, sir! I&#8217;ve done everything you asked. You said this was a good offering for the Chairman. I&#8217;ll scrub toilets even. Please.&#8221;</p><p>Bronson sighed. The foreign whispering voice echoed again through the room.</p><p>&#8220;It seems our generous Chairman has a soft spot for you.&#8221;</p><p>Jeffrey wept with gratitude.</p><p>&#8220;He wishes to meet with you in person&#8221;</p><p>Mr. Stanley and Mr. Graf grabbed Jeffrey by the arms and stood him up, holding him steady. Mr. Bronson spoke an unrecognizable language and whistled.</p><p>The conference table spilt in two and separated, revealing a massive pit spitting flames and gas. A choir of cries shrieked in agony and pleas for mercy.</p><p>The partners dragged Jeffrey towards the pit. He resisted as best he could.</p><p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Jeffrey cried as he struggled to break free.</p><p>&#8220;Making the proper introductions to our Chairman.&#8221;</p><p>The partners cried out in unison, &#8220;Hail Mammon. Hail the Prince of Riches,&#8221; and threw Jeffrey down the pit watching the flames embrace him. The conference table rejoined and the partners took their seats.</p><p>&#8220;If that doesn&#8217;t satisfied our Lord, I don&#8217;t know what will,&#8221; Mr. Stanley said.</p><p>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; said Mr. Graf &#8220;I do enjoy a good show but six sacrifices is far too much. What does this mean?&#8221;</p><p>Mr Bronson gulped down his bourbon.</p><p>&#8220;It means, gentlemen, that we must continue to make our head count until we&#8217;ve reached the satisfactory quota. Our Lord has always taken care of us. Every recession, depression, and correction he has delivered for us. Until then it&#8217;s business as usual.&#8221;</p><p>The conference phone buzzed and Mr. Graf hit the speaker button. A young voice squeaked, &#8220;I have Ms. Victoria Carrol in the lobby for you sir. Her second interview.&#8221;</p><p>Mr. Stanley and Mr. Graf snickered and cackled.</p><p>Mr. Bronson walked over to the bar to refill his glass. He took a slow sip and smiled.</p><p>&#8220;Send her up&#8221;</p><p><em>End</em></p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

His main role in the early days of the group was as the lead guitarist, helping to add texture to the songs written by his bandmates, the legendary team of John Lennon and Paul McCartney.</p><p>Throughout the band&#8217;s career, Harrison was responsible for writing just a handful of released tracks, but his efforts more than stood up to the quality of Lennon and McCartney&#8217;s</p><p>His love song <em>Something</em>, written for his wife, Patti Boyd, is regarded as one of the greatest love songs of all time. <em>Taxman</em> from the album <em>Revolver</em> was an early influence on punk rock and its riff influenced The Jam&#8217;s post-punk hit single <em>Start</em>.</p><p>He also wrote the classics <em>Here Comes The Sun</em> and <em>While My Guitar Gently Weeps</em>, the latter song being the subject of one of the greatest live guitar solos of all time when <a href="https://youtu.be/6SFNW5F8K9Y?t=207">Prince performed it at the George Harrison Tribute Concert</a>. <em>Something</em> and <em>While My Guitar Gently Weeps </em>were ranked #278 and #136 respectively in Rolling Stone&#8217;s 2004 list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>Despite these songs now being regarded as classics, at the time of writing they were seen by Lennon and McCartney, and the band&#8217;s producer George Martin, as token efforts compared to the rest of the duo&#8217;s output.</p><p>Harrison said &#8220;They had a lot of practice, put it that way. They had been writing since we were in school. So they had written most of their bad songs before we had gotten into the recording studio. For me, I had to come from nowhere and start writing and to have something at least quality enough to be able to, you know, put it in the record with all the wondrous hits.&#8221;</p><p>When recording their albums, Harrison admitted; &#8220;I&#8217;d always have to wait through ten of [John and Paul&#8217;s] songs before they&#8217;d even listen to one of mine.&#8221;</p><p>In 1968 and 1969, he released two instrumental albums, <em>Wonderwall Music</em> and <em>Electronic Sound</em>, but kept writing songs in the hope that they would end up on Beatles albums.</p><p>He later admitted to feeling creatively &#8216;constipated&#8217;. In 1969, John Lennon had said that they would make sure that George had more input on their next album, but that album never came, as the Beatles split shortly afterwards.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg" width="563" height="440" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:440,&quot;width&quot;:563,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:50567,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab31648-4c79-4dc4-b405-f3e273dbebf3_563x440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Harrison recording his classic album&#8217; All Things Must Pass&#8217; (Image: GAB Archive / Redferns</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>With Harrison building in confidence as a songwriter and lead singer, the stage was now set for the recording of his third, but first &#8216;proper&#8217;, solo album. Production started in May 1970, and the resultant album was released in November of that year.</p><p>But <em>All Things Must Pass</em> wasn&#8217;t a single or even a double album. Rare for a solo artist, it was a triple album containing 23 original tracks, with three of them lasting longer than 7 minutes. Six of the songs on the album had been rejected for inclusion on either of their final two Beatles albums, <em>Let It Be</em> and <em>Abbey Road</em>.</p><p>Critically acclaimed on release, <em>All Things Must Pass</em> is ranked #79 on The Times&#8217; 100 Best Albums of All Time and<a href="https://www.rs500albums.com/400-351/368"> #368&nbsp;on Rolling Stone&#8217;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</a> In 2014, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.</p><p>So, after feeling creatively constipated and now being free of any constraints that he felt as part of The Beatles, Harrison was able to let the creativity flow and produced his masterpiece as a result.</p><p>So, what can we learn from this?</p><p>Firstly, there&#8217;s the saying that you are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with.</p><p>While Harrison was a talented guitarist when he joined The Beatles, his song writing skills were negligent at the time, and his first recorded song, <em>Taxman</em>, was released on their seventh studio album, <em>Revolver</em>.</p><p>Spending a vast amount of time from 1958 to 1970 with Lennon and McCartney, and in the late 60s with such luminaries as Bob Dylan and The Band, Harrison saw first-hand how they constructed their songs and developed them in the studio. This clearly helped his own song writing skills to mature rapidly to expert levels.</p><p>Secondly, we need to be aware of the impact that our environment and daily routines have on our productivity.</p><p>Harrison&#8217;s role as a member of the biggest group in the world eventually became a double-edged sword in that it didn&#8217;t allow him full creative expression. Bob Dylan said: &#8220;George got stuck with being the Beatle that had to fight to get songs on records because of Lennon and McCartney. Well, who wouldn&#8217;t get stuck?&#8221;</p><p>He was in the right environment for creative consumption, but it ironically limited his freedom to be creative.</p><p>Do you have a yearning to do something different with your life, but you&#8217;re not taking any steps towards that goal? Maybe you want to write a book or start a YouTube channel but spend your free time just consuming content rather than creating it.</p><p>At some point, we need to realise that we&#8217;ve learned enough through consumption. Only by creating can we maximise the learning journey and prevent what we&#8217;ve learned from stagnating within us. The best way to do that is to develop a habit of creative experimentation and expression by allocating daily time for our creative pursuits.</p><p>Lennon and McCartney had a habit of including only their own songs on their albums, and found that habit hard to break. Harrison had a habit of acquiescing to them until he became so frustrated that he temporarily left the group in 1969. This was one of the events that contributed to the band&#8217;s eventual demise.</p><p>Similarly, what habits have you developed that actively distract you from being creative? Do you spend your time in environments that support your creativity or restrict it?</p><p>Do the limiting beliefs in your head act like Lennon and McCartney, stifling your confidence and preventing you from moving forward? It&#8217;s tough to have friends or peers restricting your creativity, but it&#8217;s tragic if you&#8217;re doing it to yourself, your mind immediately rejecting great ideas without really knowing why (though that&#8217;s another post for another day).</p><p>Are your closest contacts people who can help you move further towards your goals, or who act as barriers to them?</p><p>If The Beatles had stayed together, who&#8217;s to say that Harrison would ever have realised his true creative potential? Sometimes you have to be proactive rather than waiting for things to fall into place.</p><p>I&#8217;ll leave you with this thought - <strong>What is one thing you can do today to move you further along your creative journey?</strong></p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donations and Memberships&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stsc"><span>Donations and Memberships</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/p/the-futile-pursuit-of-a-functional?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTUyNjk5OCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTA0MDI0NTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2Nzc4MzgxOTksImV4cCI6MTY4MDQzMDE5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg3MzgyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.CovWOwL90W_Yi4z4CYv8dzv-CAuXUZTly0xirKGxm3g"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soaringtwenties.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Soaring Twenties is a reader-supported publication.

So much so that if we're not careful, we can spend all the time sitting in our physical boxes, looking into digital boxes until we're carried out in the wooden boxes.</p><p>So no wonder some of us feel boxed in.</p><p>And here's the thing: as much as we might make fun out of cats for almost immediately jumping straight into a box as soon as it appears, we fail to realize we're not all that different: <strong>we love boxes.</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg" width="1456" height="1018" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1018,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b0ebfa3-8b4a-4c9a-97c1-989c8c68d84b_1600x1119.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In fact, <strong>nothing provokes more anxiety in the average modern human as not being in any box</strong>. Having nothing to do and having an infinity of options (not being boxed in) is something that most people run away from within 10 seconds. A quick look-around on the train or in the subway confirms this.</p><p>For all the outside-the-box talk, I think a better question that takes into account our affinity for boxes is:</p><p><em>What kinds of boxes should we choose and which should we avoid?</em></p><p>Let's start with the latter.</p><h2><strong>The bad boxes</strong></h2><p>There's a pernicious habit I sometimes fall into: <strong>scrolling reels.</strong></p><p>My phone-box with funny video-boxes and comment-boxes underneath fully envelops me in a magical box that allows me to time-travel into the "I really should go to sleep" part of the evening seemingly within seconds.</p><p>Stepping inside the reel-box is a habit that makes me feel boxed in like no other. To make matters worse, 1) I'm not alone and 2) the reel format introduced by TikTok en masse is now being used by most of the big platforms. For a reason: it's addictive.</p><p>Reels are a supreme example of a bad box:</p><ul><li><p>They give you just <strong>enough novelty to trap you</strong> in.</p></li><li><p>They <strong>reduce your possible actions</strong> to: Like, Comment, Share... (and make the rest of one's choices fade away).</p></li><li><p>They <strong>leave you feeling worse off</strong> and in the overwhelming majority of cases don't lead to anything productive.</p></li></ul><p>And yet, sometimes I choose to box myself that way like a cat coming back to a barely functional but comfortable box.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg" width="656" height="788" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:788,&quot;width&quot;:656,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95767fc-50bf-48e1-b502-41cf8942e560_656x788.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>That's the danger with bad digital boxes: <strong>Play that game, open that website, scroll that app&#8212;you end up doing uncreative, unimaginative things, for hours at a time.</strong> And it's so simple to succumb&#8212;just accept the rules of the box: these are the actions you can take, these are the rewards, there you go.</p><p><strong>The trade-off is luring: no immediate existential crisis, no anxiety, here's something to do (no thinking required)</strong>. You're going through the motions and there's a certain level of short-lived peace in that. At the same time, that kind of existence is uninspired and what's sad to me is how easy it is to descend into it.</p><p>So, I try to pick my boxes better.</p><p><em>Well, Vita, what does that look like?</em></p><h2><strong>The good boxes</strong></h2><p>Not boxing ourselves in is nigh impossible so it's more about <em>*finding the best boxes possible</em>&#8212;choosing how exactly we limit our choices at any point in time.</p><p>Now, which box we choose is up to our mental state.</p><p><strong>If we're high energy, we can choose to be our own box architects (active role).</strong></p><p>For example, the editor I'm typing this in is a workshop-like box. It's open-ended. It does limit how I express myself, but I can choose to type a million different things. There are buttons, but those are on the periphery. I can express myself inside the editor box. The editor, the topic, the time of day&#8212;these are the boxes I chose today. I could also pick an entirely different box like a swing dance class (box of time, space, and people), or I might code (editor = box, home office = box).</p><p><strong>Good boxes like the above are vehicles for self-expression and self-realization.</strong> They lack predefined actions like <em>Like</em>, <em>Share</em>, <em>Subscribe</em> and as such, they make more of our own genius manifest.</p><p>When I have the energy or the will, I will look for open-ended boxes where I define the actions to take and lay the tracks before me myself, to pursue my own goals.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif" width="320" height="240" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:165,&quot;width&quot;:220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90e5b6bc-1752-439a-9263-9d640bfd20f8_220x165.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But Vita, what if I'm not high energy right now?</p><p><strong>If we're low energy, we can pick a better pre-prepared box.</strong></p><p>There are some good ready-to-go boxes out there: good movies, good books, good experiences (walk outside, art exhibition, chat with a friend you haven't seen in a while),...
